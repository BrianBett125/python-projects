## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**GARRETT:** Can I ask you something kind of personal?

**ANDRE:** Yeah, man. What's up?

**GARRETT:** How often do you and Vanessa have sex?

**ANDRE:** Whoa. That's pretty direct.

**GARRETT:** I know. Sorry. You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out if what's happening with me and Taylor is normal or not.

**ANDRE:** What's happening?

**GARRETT:** We're just... not on the same page. Like, at all. When it comes to sex.

**ANDRE:** How so?

**GARRETT:** I want it way more than she does. And it's starting to become a problem.

**ANDRE:** Define way more.

**GARRETT:** I don't know. I'd be happy with three, four times a week. She's more like once a week. Maybe twice if I'm lucky.

**ANDRE:** And that's not enough for you?

**GARRETT:** Not really. I mean, it's not just about the frequency. It's about feeling wanted. Connected. When we go a week without sex, I start to feel like we're just roommates.

**ANDRE:** Have you told her that?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. Multiple times. She says she's tired. Or stressed. Or not in the mood. And I get it. Life is busy. But it feels like there's always an excuse.

**ANDRE:** Does she ever initiate?

**GARRETT:** Almost never. It's always me. And half the time when I try, she shuts me down.

**ANDRE:** That's gotta be frustrating.

**GARRETT:** It's more than frustrating. It's starting to mess with my head. Like, am I not attractive to her anymore? Is she not into me?

**ANDRE:** What does she say when you ask her that?

**GARRETT:** She says of course she's attracted to me. That it has nothing to do with that. But I don't know, man. Actions speak louder than words.

**ANDRE:** Maybe her sex drive is just lower than yours. That's pretty common.

**GARRETT:** I know it's common. But how do you deal with it? How do you not take it personally?

**ANDRE:** I mean, Vanessa and I aren't exactly rabbits either. We probably average twice a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

**GARRETT:** And that works for both of you?

**ANDRE:** It works well enough. There are times I'd like more, but I'm not gonna pressure her if she's not feeling it.

**GARRETT:** See, that's where I struggle. I don't want to pressure her. But I also don't want to just accept a sexless relationship.

**ANDRE:** Once a week isn't sexless.

**GARRETT:** It feels like it to me. Especially when I think about how things used to be.

**ANDRE:** What do you mean?

**GARRETT:** When we first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We'd have sex multiple times a day sometimes. It was intense.

**ANDRE:** That's the honeymoon phase, dude. It always slows down.

**GARRETT:** I know. But this feels like more than slowing down. This feels like stopping.

**ANDRE:** How long have you guys been together now?

**GARRETT:** Three years. We moved in together about six months ago.

**ANDRE:** And when did the sex drop off?

**GARRETT:** Pretty much right after we moved in. At first I thought it was just the stress of the move. But it's been six months and nothing's changed.

**ANDRE:** Did something happen? Like a specific incident?

**GARRETT:** Not that I know of. We didn't have a fight or anything. It just gradually became less frequent.

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. She says everything's fine. That she's just not as sexual as she used to be. Which makes me feel great, by the way.

**ANDRE:** I'm sure she didn't mean it like that.

**GARRETT:** Maybe not. But that's how it landed. Like, our relationship made her less interested in sex. How is that not a red flag?

**ANDRE:** Could be hormonal. Could be stress. Could be a million things that have nothing to do with you.

**GARRETT:** Then why won't she do something about it? I suggested she talk to her doctor. She blew me off.

**ANDRE:** She probably doesn't see it as a medical issue.

**GARRETT:** But what if it is? What if her hormones are off or something? Wouldn't she want to know?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** Am I? Am I making too big a deal out of this?

**ANDRE:** I don't know, man. Sex is important in a relationship. But so is respecting your partner's boundaries.

**GARRETT:** I'm not crossing any boundaries. I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just expressing that I have needs too.

**ANDRE:** And what does she say when you express that?

**GARRETT:** She gets defensive. Says I'm making her feel bad about herself. That I'm pressuring her.

**ANDRE:** Are you pressuring her?

**GARRETT:** I don't think so. But maybe I am without realizing it. Like, if I bring it up too much, is that pressure?

**ANDRE:** Depends on how you bring it up.

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** Because to her, it probably feels like you're saying she's not doing enough.

**GARRETT:** But she's not. That's the problem. I'm not getting what I need from this relationship.

**ANDRE:** Okay, but have you asked her what she needs?

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** Like, maybe there's a reason she's not in the mood. Maybe there's something you could be doing differently that would help.

**GARRETT:** I've asked. She says she doesn't know. That she's just not feeling it.

**ANDRE:** That's frustrating.

**GARRETT:** Tell me about it. I'm trying to problem-solve here, and she won't even engage with the conversation.

**ANDRE:** Maybe she feels attacked. Like you're saying there's something wrong with her.

**GARRETT:** I'm not saying there's something wrong with her. I'm saying we have incompatible sex drives. That's not an attack, it's just a fact.

**ANDRE:** But the way you frame it matters. If you're coming at it like it's her fault, she's gonna shut down.

**GARRETT:** How else am I supposed to frame it? She's the one who's not interested.

**ANDRE:** See, that right there. You're making it about her not being interested. What if it's about you not creating the right environment for her to be interested?

**GARRETT:** What does that even mean?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. I'm not in your relationship. But maybe there's emotional stuff that needs to happen before physical stuff. For some people, that's how it works.

**GARRETT:** You think I'm not being emotionally available?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** Not in those exact words. But I've asked if she needs more romance or whatever. She said no.

**ANDRE:** What about stress? You said she's stressed. Is work bad right now?

**GARRETT:** Yeah, actually. She's been working late a lot. Her boss is kind of a nightmare.

**ANDRE:** So she comes home exhausted and you want to have sex. I can see how that might not line up.

**GARRETT:** I'm not jumping her the second she walks in the door. I give her space. But eventually, we need to connect. We can't just be two tired people living in the same apartment.

**ANDRE:** True. But if she's running on empty, sex might just feel like another obligation.

**GARRETT:** So what am I supposed to do? Just wait until her job gets better? That could be months. Years.

**ANDRE:** No, but you might need to adjust your expectations. And find other ways to feel connected that aren't sex.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Spending quality time together. Going on dates. Doing things she enjoys.

**GARRETT:** We do that stuff. We go out to dinner. We watch shows together. But it doesn't lead to anything physical.

**ANDRE:** Maybe it's not supposed to lead to anything. Maybe it's just about being together.

**GARRETT:** I hear you, but I need physical intimacy. That's a legitimate need.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**ANDRE:** No. You're supposed to figure out if this is something you can live with or not.

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**GARRETT:** What if she's fine with how things are? What if she doesn't see it as a problem?

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?

**ANDRE:** Not to this extent. But we've had conversations about it. There've been times when one of us wanted more and the other wasn't feeling it.

**ANDRE:** How did you work through it?

**ANDRE:** We just talked it out. Made sure we were both feeling heard. And we try to meet in the middle. Like, if she's not in the mood for full-on sex, maybe we do something else. Just to maintain that physical connection.

**GARRETT:** Taylor won't even do that. If she's not in the mood, that's it. Everything's off the table.

**ANDRE:** That's tough. Because you're right, you need some kind of physical intimacy. Even if it's not always sex.

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**ANDRE:** And you do respect it. But you're allowed to be frustrated about it.

**GARRETT:** Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to be frustrated. Like I'm supposed to just be understanding all the time.

**ANDRE:** You can be both. You can understand where she's coming from and still have your own feelings about it.

**GARRETT:** I just don't know how to fix this. We're stuck.

**ANDRE:** Maybe you need to have a bigger conversation. Not just about sex, but about the relationship as a whole. See if there are other issues hiding underneath.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** You might be onto something. Things have felt off in general lately. Not just the sex stuff.

**ANDRE:** There you go. Maybe start there. Talk about how you're both feeling about the relationship. See what comes up.

**GARRETT:** And if nothing comes up? If she says everything's fine except for my constant need for sex?

**ANDRE:** Then you're back to the same question. Can you live with this long-term or not?

**GARRETT:** I don't think I can. Not if it stays like this.

**ANDRE:** Then you might need to tell her that. Not as an ultimatum, but as honest communication about where you're at.

**GARRETT:** That's scary though. What if she says she can't change? Or won't change?

**ANDRE:** Then you have your answer. And you can make a decision from there.

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** I know. But you also can't stay in a relationship where you're constantly unsatisfied. That's not fair to either of you.

**GARRETT:** Yeah. You're right. I need to think about this more. Maybe talk to her this weekend when we actually have time.

**ANDRE:** Good idea. And go into it without expectations. Just be honest about how you're feeling.

**GARRETT:** I will. Thanks for talking this through with me. I know it's awkward.

**ANDRE:** It's not awkward. This is what friends do. We talk about the uncomfortable stuff.

**GARRETT:** Still. I appreciate it.

**ANDRE:** Anytime, man. Let me know how it goes.## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. She says everything's fine. That she's just not as sexual as she used to be. Which makes me feel great, by the way.

**ANDRE:** I'm sure she didn't mean it like that.

**GARRETT:** Maybe not. But that's how it landed. Like, our relationship made her less interested in sex. How is that not a red flag?

**ANDRE:** Could be hormonal. Could be stress. Could be a million things that have nothing to do with you.

**GARRETT:** Then why won't she do something about it? I suggested she talk to her doctor. She blew me off.

**ANDRE:** She probably doesn't see it as a medical issue.

**GARRETT:** But what if it is? What if her hormones are off or something? Wouldn't she want to know?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** Am I? Am I making too big a deal out of this?

**ANDRE:** I don't know, man. Sex is important in a relationship. But so is respecting your partner's boundaries.

**GARRETT:** I'm not crossing any boundaries. I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just expressing that I have needs too.

**ANDRE:** And what does she say when you express that?

**GARRETT:** She gets defensive. Says I'm making her feel bad about herself. That I'm pressuring her.

**ANDRE:** Are you pressuring her?

**GARRETT:** I don't think so. But maybe I am without realizing it. Like, if I bring it up too much, is that pressure?

**ANDRE:** Depends on how you bring it up.

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** Because to her, it probably feels like you're saying she's not doing enough.

**GARRETT:** But she's not. That's the problem. I'm not getting what I need from this relationship.

**ANDRE:** Okay, but have you asked her what she needs?

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** Like, maybe there's a reason she's not in the mood. Maybe there's something you could be doing differently that would help.

**GARRETT:** I've asked. She says she doesn't know. That she's just not feeling it.

**ANDRE:** That's frustrating.

**GARRETT:** Tell me about it. I'm trying to problem-solve here, and she won't even engage with the conversation.

**ANDRE:** Maybe she feels attacked. Like you're saying there's something wrong with her.

**GARRETT:** I'm not saying there's something wrong with her. I'm saying we have incompatible sex drives. That's not an attack, it's just a fact.

**ANDRE:** But the way you frame it matters. If you're coming at it like it's her fault, she's gonna shut down.

**GARRETT:** How else am I supposed to frame it? She's the one who's not interested.

**ANDRE:** See, that right there. You're making it about her not being interested. What if it's about you not creating the right environment for her to be interested?

**GARRETT:** What does that even mean?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. I'm not in your relationship. But maybe there's emotional stuff that needs to happen before physical stuff. For some people, that's how it works.

**GARRETT:** You think I'm not being emotionally available?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** Not in those exact words. But I've asked if she needs more romance or whatever. She said no.

**ANDRE:** What about stress? You said she's stressed. Is work bad right now?

**GARRETT:** Yeah, actually. She's been working late a lot. Her boss is kind of a nightmare.

**ANDRE:** So she comes home exhausted and you want to have sex. I can see how that might not line up.

**GARRETT:** I'm not jumping her the second she walks in the door. I give her space. But eventually, we need to connect. We can't just be two tired people living in the same apartment.

**ANDRE:** True. But if she's running on empty, sex might just feel like another obligation.

**GARRETT:** So what am I supposed to do? Just wait until her job gets better? That could be months. Years.

**ANDRE:** No, but you might need to adjust your expectations. And find other ways to feel connected that aren't sex.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Spending quality time together. Going on dates. Doing things she enjoys.

**GARRETT:** We do that stuff. We go out to dinner. We watch shows together. But it doesn't lead to anything physical.

**ANDRE:** Maybe it's not supposed to lead to anything. Maybe it's just about being together.

**GARRETT:** I hear you, but I need physical intimacy. That's a legitimate need.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**ANDRE:** No. You're supposed to figure out if this is something you can live with or not.

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**GARRETT:** What if she's fine with how things are? What if she doesn't see it as a problem?

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?

**ANDRE:** Not to this extent. But we've had conversations about it. There've been times when one of us wanted more and the other wasn't feeling it.

**ANDRE:** How did you work through it?

**ANDRE:** We just talked it out. Made sure we were both feeling heard. And we try to meet in the middle. Like, if she's not in the mood for full-on sex, maybe we do something else. Just to maintain that physical connection.

**GARRETT:** Taylor won't even do that. If she's not in the mood, that's it. Everything's off the table.

**ANDRE:** That's tough. Because you're right, you need some kind of physical intimacy. Even if it's not always sex.

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**ANDRE:** And you do respect it. But you're allowed to be frustrated about it.

**GARRETT:** Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to be frustrated. Like I'm supposed to just be understanding all the time.

**ANDRE:** You can be both. You can understand where she's coming from and still have your own feelings about it.

**GARRETT:** I just don't know how to fix this. We're stuck.

**ANDRE:** Maybe you need to have a bigger conversation. Not just about sex, but about the relationship as a whole. See if there are other issues hiding underneath.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** You might be onto something. Things have felt off in general lately. Not just the sex stuff.

**ANDRE:** There you go. Maybe start there. Talk about how you're both feeling about the relationship. See what comes up.

**GARRETT:** And if nothing comes up? If she says everything's fine except for my constant need for sex?

**ANDRE:** Then you're back to the same question. Can you live with this long-term or not?

**GARRETT:** I don't think I can. Not if it stays like this.

**ANDRE:** Then you might need to tell her that. Not as an ultimatum, but as honest communication about where you're at.

**GARRETT:** That's scary though. What if she says she can't change? Or won't change?

**ANDRE:** Then you have your answer. And you can make a decision from there.

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** I know. But you also can't stay in a relationship where you're constantly unsatisfied. That's not fair to either of you.

**GARRETT:** Yeah. You're right. I need to think about this more. Maybe talk to her this weekend when we actually have time.

**ANDRE:** Good idea. And go into it without expectations. Just be honest about how you're feeling.

**GARRETT:** I will. Thanks for talking this through with me. I know it's awkward.

**ANDRE:** It's not awkward. This is what friends do. We talk about the uncomfortable stuff.

**GARRETT:** Still. I appreciate it.

**ANDRE:** Anytime, man. Let me know how it goes.## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**GARRETT:** Can I ask you something kind of personal?

**ANDRE:** Yeah, man. What's up?

**GARRETT:** How often do you and Vanessa have sex?

**ANDRE:** Whoa. That's pretty direct.

**GARRETT:** I know. Sorry. You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out if what's happening with me and Taylor is normal or not.

**ANDRE:** What's happening?

**GARRETT:** We're just... not on the same page. Like, at all. When it comes to sex.

**ANDRE:** How so?

**GARRETT:** I want it way more than she does. And it's starting to become a problem.

**ANDRE:** Define way more.

**GARRETT:** I don't know. I'd be happy with three, four times a week. She's more like once a week. Maybe twice if I'm lucky.

**ANDRE:** And that's not enough for you?

**GARRETT:** Not really. I mean, it's not just about the frequency. It's about feeling wanted. Connected. When we go a week without sex, I start to feel like we're just roommates.

**ANDRE:** Have you told her that?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. Multiple times. She says she's tired. Or stressed. Or not in the mood. And I get it. Life is busy. But it feels like there's always an excuse.

**ANDRE:** Does she ever initiate?

**GARRETT:** Almost never. It's always me. And half the time when I try, she shuts me down.

**ANDRE:** That's gotta be frustrating.

**GARRETT:** It's more than frustrating. It's starting to mess with my head. Like, am I not attractive to her anymore? Is she not into me?

**ANDRE:** What does she say when you ask her that?

**GARRETT:** She says of course she's attracted to me. That it has nothing to do with that. But I don't know, man. Actions speak louder than words.

**ANDRE:** Maybe her sex drive is just lower than yours. That's pretty common.

**GARRETT:** I know it's common. But how do you deal with it? How do you not take it personally?

**ANDRE:** I mean, Vanessa and I aren't exactly rabbits either. We probably average twice a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

**GARRETT:** And that works for both of you?

**ANDRE:** It works well enough. There are times I'd like more, but I'm not gonna pressure her if she's not feeling it.

**GARRETT:** See, that's where I struggle. I don't want to pressure her. But I also don't want to just accept a sexless relationship.

**ANDRE:** Once a week isn't sexless.

**GARRETT:** It feels like it to me. Especially when I think about how things used to be.

**ANDRE:** What do you mean?

**GARRETT:** When we first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We'd have sex multiple times a day sometimes. It was intense.

**ANDRE:** That's the honeymoon phase, dude. It always slows down.

**GARRETT:** I know. But this feels like more than slowing down. This feels like stopping.

**ANDRE:** How long have you guys been together now?

**GARRETT:** Three years. We moved in together about six months ago.

**ANDRE:** And when did the sex drop off?

**GARRETT:** Pretty much right after we moved in. At first I thought it was just the stress of the move. But it's been six months and nothing's changed.

**ANDRE:** Did something happen? Like a specific incident?

**GARRETT:** Not that I know of. We didn't have a fight or anything. It just gradually became less frequent.

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** Not in those exact words. But I've asked if she needs more romance or whatever. She said no.

**ANDRE:** What about stress? You said she's stressed. Is work bad right now?

**GARRETT:** Yeah, actually. She's been working late a lot. Her boss is kind of a nightmare.

**ANDRE:** So she comes home exhausted and you want to have sex. I can see how that might not line up.

**GARRETT:** I'm not jumping her the second she walks in the door. I give her space. But eventually, we need to connect. We can't just be two tired people living in the same apartment.

**ANDRE:** True. But if she's running on empty, sex might just feel like another obligation.

**GARRETT:** So what am I supposed to do? Just wait until her job gets better? That could be months. Years.

**ANDRE:** No, but you might need to adjust your expectations. And find other ways to feel connected that aren't sex.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Spending quality time together. Going on dates. Doing things she enjoys.

**GARRETT:** We do that stuff. We go out to dinner. We watch shows together. But it doesn't lead to anything physical.

**ANDRE:** Maybe it's not supposed to lead to anything. Maybe it's just about being together.

**GARRETT:** I hear you, but I need physical intimacy. That's a legitimate need.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**ANDRE:** No. You're supposed to figure out if this is something you can live with or not.

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**GARRETT:** What if she's fine with how things are? What if she doesn't see it as a problem?

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?

**ANDRE:** Not to this extent. But we've had conversations about it. There've been times when one of us wanted more and the other wasn't feeling it.

**ANDRE:** How did you work through it?

**ANDRE:** We just talked it out. Made sure we were both feeling heard. And we try to meet in the middle. Like, if she's not in the mood for full-on sex, maybe we do something else. Just to maintain that physical connection.

**GARRETT:** Taylor won't even do that. If she's not in the mood, that's it. Everything's off the table.

**ANDRE:** That's tough. Because you're right, you need some kind of physical intimacy. Even if it's not always sex.

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**ANDRE:** And you do respect it. But you're allowed to be frustrated about it.

**GARRETT:** Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to be frustrated. Like I'm supposed to just be understanding all the time.

**ANDRE:** You can be both. You can understand where she's coming from and still have your own feelings about it.

**GARRETT:** I just don't know how to fix this. We're stuck.

**ANDRE:** Maybe you need to have a bigger conversation. Not just about sex, but about the relationship as a whole. See if there are other issues hiding underneath.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** You might be onto something. Things have felt off in general lately. Not just the sex stuff.

**ANDRE:** There you go. Maybe start there. Talk about how you're both feeling about the relationship. See what comes up.

**GARRETT:** And if nothing comes up? If she says everything's fine except for my constant need for sex?

**ANDRE:** Then you're back to the same question. Can you live with this long-term or not?

**GARRETT:** I don't think I can. Not if it stays like this.

**ANDRE:** Then you might need to tell her that. Not as an ultimatum, but as honest communication about where you're at.

**GARRETT:** That's scary though. What if she says she can't change? Or won't change?

**ANDRE:** Then you have your answer. And you can make a decision from there.

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** I know. But you also can't stay in a relationship where you're constantly unsatisfied. That's not fair to either of you.

**GARRETT:** Yeah. You're right. I need to think about this more. Maybe talk to her this weekend when we actually have time.

**ANDRE:** Good idea. And go into it without expectations. Just be honest about how you're feeling.

**GARRETT:** I will. Thanks for talking this through with me. I know it's awkward.

**ANDRE:** It's not awkward. This is what friends do. We talk about the uncomfortable stuff.

**GARRETT:** Still. I appreciate it.

**ANDRE:** Anytime, man. Let me know how it goes.## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**GARRETT:** Can I ask you something kind of personal?

**ANDRE:** Yeah, man. What's up?

**GARRETT:** How often do you and Vanessa have sex?

**ANDRE:** Whoa. That's pretty direct.

**GARRETT:** I know. Sorry. You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out if what's happening with me and Taylor is normal or not.

**ANDRE:** What's happening?

**GARRETT:** We're just... not on the same page. Like, at all. When it comes to sex.

**ANDRE:** How so?

**GARRETT:** I want it way more than she does. And it's starting to become a problem.

**ANDRE:** Define way more.

**GARRETT:** I don't know. I'd be happy with three, four times a week. She's more like once a week. Maybe twice if I'm lucky.

**ANDRE:** And that's not enough for you?

**GARRETT:** Not really. I mean, it's not just about the frequency. It's about feeling wanted. Connected. When we go a week without sex, I start to feel like we're just roommates.

**ANDRE:** Have you told her that?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. Multiple times. She says she's tired. Or stressed. Or not in the mood. And I get it. Life is busy. But it feels like there's always an excuse.

**ANDRE:** Does she ever initiate?

**GARRETT:** Almost never. It's always me. And half the time when I try, she shuts me down.

**ANDRE:** That's gotta be frustrating.

**GARRETT:** It's more than frustrating. It's starting to mess with my head. Like, am I not attractive to her anymore? Is she not into me?

**ANDRE:** What does she say when you ask her that?

**GARRETT:** She says of course she's attracted to me. That it has nothing to do with that. But I don't know, man. Actions speak louder than words.

**ANDRE:** Maybe her sex drive is just lower than yours. That's pretty common.

**GARRETT:** I know it's common. But how do you deal with it? How do you not take it personally?

**ANDRE:** I mean, Vanessa and I aren't exactly rabbits either. We probably average twice a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

**GARRETT:** And that works for both of you?

**ANDRE:** It works well enough. There are times I'd like more, but I'm not gonna pressure her if she's not feeling it.

**GARRETT:** See, that's where I struggle. I don't want to pressure her. But I also don't want to just accept a sexless relationship.

**ANDRE:** Once a week isn't sexless.

**GARRETT:** It feels like it to me. Especially when I think about how things used to be.

**ANDRE:** What do you mean?

**GARRETT:** When we first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We'd have sex multiple times a day sometimes. It was intense.

**ANDRE:** That's the honeymoon phase, dude. It always slows down.

**GARRETT:** I know. But this feels like more than slowing down. This feels like stopping.

**ANDRE:** How long have you guys been together now?

**GARRETT:** Three years. We moved in together about six months ago.

**ANDRE:** And when did the sex drop off?

**GARRETT:** Pretty much right after we moved in. At first I thought it was just the stress of the move. But it's been six months and nothing's changed.

**ANDRE:** Did something happen? Like a specific incident?

**GARRETT:** Not that I know of. We didn't have a fight or anything. It just gradually became less frequent.

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. She says everything's fine. That she's just not as sexual as she used to be. Which makes me feel great, by the way.

**ANDRE:** I'm sure she didn't mean it like that.

**GARRETT:** Maybe not. But that's how it landed. Like, our relationship made her less interested in sex. How is that not a red flag?

**ANDRE:** Could be hormonal. Could be stress. Could be a million things that have nothing to do with you.

**GARRETT:** Then why won't she do something about it? I suggested she talk to her doctor. She blew me off.

**ANDRE:** She probably doesn't see it as a medical issue.

**GARRETT:** But what if it is? What if her hormones are off or something? Wouldn't she want to know?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** Am I? Am I making too big a deal out of this?

**ANDRE:** I don't know, man. Sex is important in a relationship. But so is respecting your partner's boundaries.

**GARRETT:** I'm not crossing any boundaries. I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just expressing that I have needs too.

**ANDRE:** And what does she say when you express that?

**GARRETT:** She gets defensive. Says I'm making her feel bad about herself. That I'm pressuring her.

**ANDRE:** Are you pressuring her?

**GARRETT:** I don't think so. But maybe I am without realizing it. Like, if I bring it up too much, is that pressure?

**ANDRE:** Depends on how you bring it up.

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** Because to her, it probably feels like you're saying she's not doing enough.

**GARRETT:** But she's not. That's the problem. I'm not getting what I need from this relationship.

**ANDRE:** Okay, but have you asked her what she needs?

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** Like, maybe there's a reason she's not in the mood. Maybe there's something you could be doing differently that would help.

**GARRETT:** I've asked. She says she doesn't know. That she's just not feeling it.

**ANDRE:** That's frustrating.

**GARRETT:** Tell me about it. I'm trying to problem-solve here, and she won't even engage with the conversation.

**ANDRE:** Maybe she feels attacked. Like you're saying there's something wrong with her.

**GARRETT:** I'm not saying there's something wrong with her. I'm saying we have incompatible sex drives. That's not an attack, it's just a fact.

**ANDRE:** But the way you frame it matters. If you're coming at it like it's her fault, she's gonna shut down.

**GARRETT:** How else am I supposed to frame it? She's the one who's not interested.

**ANDRE:** See, that right there. You're making it about her not being interested. What if it's about you not creating the right environment for her to be interested?

**GARRETT:** What does that even mean?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. I'm not in your relationship. But maybe there's emotional stuff that needs to happen before physical stuff. For some people, that's how it works.

**GARRETT:** You think I'm not being emotionally available?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**ANDRE:** And you do respect it. But you're allowed to be frustrated about it.

**GARRETT:** Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to be frustrated. Like I'm supposed to just be understanding all the time.

**ANDRE:** You can be both. You can understand where she's coming from and still have your own feelings about it.

**GARRETT:** I just don't know how to fix this. We're stuck.

**ANDRE:** Maybe you need to have a bigger conversation. Not just about sex, but about the relationship as a whole. See if there are other issues hiding underneath.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** You might be onto something. Things have felt off in general lately. Not just the sex stuff.

**ANDRE:** There you go. Maybe start there. Talk about how you're both feeling about the relationship. See what comes up.

**GARRETT:** And if nothing comes up? If she says everything's fine except for my constant need for sex?

**ANDRE:** Then you're back to the same question. Can you live with this long-term or not?

**GARRETT:** I don't think I can. Not if it stays like this.

**ANDRE:** Then you might need to tell her that. Not as an ultimatum, but as honest communication about where you're at.

**GARRETT:** That's scary though. What if she says she can't change? Or won't change?

**ANDRE:** Then you have your answer. And you can make a decision from there.

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** I know. But you also can't stay in a relationship where you're constantly unsatisfied. That's not fair to either of you.

**GARRETT:** Yeah. You're right. I need to think about this more. Maybe talk to her this weekend when we actually have time.

**ANDRE:** Good idea. And go into it without expectations. Just be honest about how you're feeling.

**GARRETT:** I will. Thanks for talking this through with me. I know it's awkward.

**ANDRE:** It's not awkward. This is what friends do. We talk about the uncomfortable stuff.

**GARRETT:** Still. I appreciate it.

**ANDRE:** Anytime, man. Let me know how it goes.## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**GARRETT:** Can I ask you something kind of personal?

**ANDRE:** Yeah, man. What's up?

**GARRETT:** How often do you and Vanessa have sex?

**ANDRE:** Whoa. That's pretty direct.

**GARRETT:** I know. Sorry. You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out if what's happening with me and Taylor is normal or not.

**ANDRE:** What's happening?

**GARRETT:** We're just... not on the same page. Like, at all. When it comes to sex.

**ANDRE:** How so?

**GARRETT:** I want it way more than she does. And it's starting to become a problem.

**ANDRE:** Define way more.

**GARRETT:** I don't know. I'd be happy with three, four times a week. She's more like once a week. Maybe twice if I'm lucky.

**ANDRE:** And that's not enough for you?

**GARRETT:** Not really. I mean, it's not just about the frequency. It's about feeling wanted. Connected. When we go a week without sex, I start to feel like we're just roommates.

**ANDRE:** Have you told her that?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. Multiple times. She says she's tired. Or stressed. Or not in the mood. And I get it. Life is busy. But it feels like there's always an excuse.

**ANDRE:** Does she ever initiate?

**GARRETT:** Almost never. It's always me. And half the time when I try, she shuts me down.

**ANDRE:** That's gotta be frustrating.

**GARRETT:** It's more than frustrating. It's starting to mess with my head. Like, am I not attractive to her anymore? Is she not into me?

**ANDRE:** What does she say when you ask her that?

**GARRETT:** She says of course she's attracted to me. That it has nothing to do with that. But I don't know, man. Actions speak louder than words.

**ANDRE:** Maybe her sex drive is just lower than yours. That's pretty common.

**GARRETT:** I know it's common. But how do you deal with it? How do you not take it personally?

**ANDRE:** I mean, Vanessa and I aren't exactly rabbits either. We probably average twice a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

**GARRETT:** And that works for both of you?

**ANDRE:** It works well enough. There are times I'd like more, but I'm not gonna pressure her if she's not feeling it.

**GARRETT:** See, that's where I struggle. I don't want to pressure her. But I also don't want to just accept a sexless relationship.

**ANDRE:** Once a week isn't sexless.

**GARRETT:** It feels like it to me. Especially when I think about how things used to be.

**ANDRE:** What do you mean?

**GARRETT:** When we first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We'd have sex multiple times a day sometimes. It was intense.

**ANDRE:** That's the honeymoon phase, dude. It always slows down.

**GARRETT:** I know. But this feels like more than slowing down. This feels like stopping.

**ANDRE:** How long have you guys been together now?

**GARRETT:** Three years. We moved in together about six months ago.

**ANDRE:** And when did the sex drop off?

**GARRETT:** Pretty much right after we moved in. At first I thought it was just the stress of the move. But it's been six months and nothing's changed.

**ANDRE:** Did something happen? Like a specific incident?

**GARRETT:** Not that I know of. We didn't have a fight or anything. It just gradually became less frequent.

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. She says everything's fine. That she's just not as sexual as she used to be. Which makes me feel great, by the way.

**ANDRE:** I'm sure she didn't mean it like that.

**GARRETT:** Maybe not. But that's how it landed. Like, our relationship made her less interested in sex. How is that not a red flag?

**ANDRE:** Could be hormonal. Could be stress. Could be a million things that have nothing to do with you.

**GARRETT:** Then why won't she do something about it? I suggested she talk to her doctor. She blew me off.

**ANDRE:** She probably doesn't see it as a medical issue.

**GARRETT:** But what if it is? What if her hormones are off or something? Wouldn't she want to know?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** Am I? Am I making too big a deal out of this?

**ANDRE:** I don't know, man. Sex is important in a relationship. But so is respecting your partner's boundaries.

**GARRETT:** I'm not crossing any boundaries. I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just expressing that I have needs too.

**ANDRE:** And what does she say when you express that?

**GARRETT:** She gets defensive. Says I'm making her feel bad about herself. That I'm pressuring her.

**ANDRE:** Are you pressuring her?

**GARRETT:** I don't think so. But maybe I am without realizing it. Like, if I bring it up too much, is that pressure?

**ANDRE:** Depends on how you bring it up.

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** Because to her, it probably feels like you're saying she's not doing enough.

**GARRETT:** But she's not. That's the problem. I'm not getting what I need from this relationship.

**ANDRE:** Okay, but have you asked her what she needs?

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** Like, maybe there's a reason she's not in the mood. Maybe there's something you could be doing differently that would help.

**GARRETT:** I've asked. She says she doesn't know. That she's just not feeling it.

**ANDRE:** That's frustrating.

**GARRETT:** Tell me about it. I'm trying to problem-solve here, and she won't even engage with the conversation.

**ANDRE:** Maybe she feels attacked. Like you're saying there's something wrong with her.

**GARRETT:** I'm not saying there's something wrong with her. I'm saying we have incompatible sex drives. That's not an attack, it's just a fact.

**ANDRE:** But the way you frame it matters. If you're coming at it like it's her fault, she's gonna shut down.

**GARRETT:** How else am I supposed to frame it? She's the one who's not interested.

**ANDRE:** See, that right there. You're making it about her not being interested. What if it's about you not creating the right environment for her to be interested?

**GARRETT:** What does that even mean?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. I'm not in your relationship. But maybe there's emotional stuff that needs to happen before physical stuff. For some people, that's how it works.

**GARRETT:** You think I'm not being emotionally available?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** Not in those exact words. But I've asked if she needs more romance or whatever. She said no.

**ANDRE:** What about stress? You said she's stressed. Is work bad right now?

**GARRETT:** Yeah, actually. She's been working late a lot. Her boss is kind of a nightmare.

**ANDRE:** So she comes home exhausted and you want to have sex. I can see how that might not line up.

**GARRETT:** I'm not jumping her the second she walks in the door. I give her space. But eventually, we need to connect. We can't just be two tired people living in the same apartment.

**ANDRE:** True. But if she's running on empty, sex might just feel like another obligation.

**GARRETT:** So what am I supposed to do? Just wait until her job gets better? That could be months. Years.

**ANDRE:** No, but you might need to adjust your expectations. And find other ways to feel connected that aren't sex.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Spending quality time together. Going on dates. Doing things she enjoys.

**GARRETT:** We do that stuff. We go out to dinner. We watch shows together. But it doesn't lead to anything physical.

**ANDRE:** Maybe it's not supposed to lead to anything. Maybe it's just about being together.

**GARRETT:** I hear you, but I need physical intimacy. That's a legitimate need.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**ANDRE:** No. You're supposed to figure out if this is something you can live with or not.

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**GARRETT:** What if she's fine with how things are? What if she doesn't see it as a problem?

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?

**ANDRE:** Not to this extent. But we've had conversations about it. There've been times when one of us wanted more and the other wasn't feeling it.

**ANDRE:** How did you work through it?

**ANDRE:** We just talked it out. Made sure we were both feeling heard. And we try to meet in the middle. Like, if she's not in the mood for full-on sex, maybe we do something else. Just to maintain that physical connection.

**GARRETT:** Taylor won't even do that. If she's not in the mood, that's it. Everything's off the table.

**ANDRE:** That's tough. Because you're right, you need some kind of physical intimacy. Even if it's not always sex.

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**GARRETT:** Not really. I mean, it's not just about the frequency. It's about feeling wanted. Connected. When we go a week without sex, I start to feel like we're just roommates.

**ANDRE:** Have you told her that?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. Multiple times. She says she's tired. Or stressed. Or not in the mood. And I get it. Life is busy. But it feels like there's always an excuse.

**ANDRE:** Does she ever initiate?

**GARRETT:** Almost never. It's always me. And half the time when I try, she shuts me down.

**ANDRE:** That's gotta be frustrating.

**GARRETT:** It's more than frustrating. It's starting to mess with my head. Like, am I not attractive to her anymore? Is she not into me?

**ANDRE:** What does she say when you ask her that?

**GARRETT:** She says of course she's attracted to me. That it has nothing to do with that. But I don't know, man. Actions speak louder than words.

**ANDRE:** Maybe her sex drive is just lower than yours. That's pretty common.

**GARRETT:** I know it's common. But how do you deal with it? How do you not take it personally?

**ANDRE:** I mean, Vanessa and I aren't exactly rabbits either. We probably average twice a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

**GARRETT:** And that works for both of you?

**ANDRE:** It works well enough. There are times I'd like more, but I'm not gonna pressure her if she's not feeling it.

**GARRETT:** See, that's where I struggle. I don't want to pressure her. But I also don't want to just accept a sexless relationship.

**ANDRE:** Once a week isn't sexless.

**GARRETT:** It feels like it to me. Especially when I think about how things used to be.

**ANDRE:** What do you mean?

**GARRETT:** When we first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We'd have sex multiple times a day sometimes. It was intense.

**ANDRE:** That's the honeymoon phase, dude. It always slows down.

**GARRETT:** I know. But this feels like more than slowing down. This feels like stopping.

**ANDRE:** How long have you guys been together now?

**GARRETT:** Three years. We moved in together about six months ago.

**ANDRE:** And when did the sex drop off?

**GARRETT:** Pretty much right after we moved in. At first I thought it was just the stress of the move. But it's been six months and nothing's changed.

**ANDRE:** Did something happen? Like a specific incident?

**GARRETT:** Not that I know of. We didn't have a fight or anything. It just gradually became less frequent.

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. She says everything's fine. That she's just not as sexual as she used to be. Which makes me feel great, by the way.

**ANDRE:** I'm sure she didn't mean it like that.

**GARRETT:** Maybe not. But that's how it landed. Like, our relationship made her less interested in sex. How is that not a red flag?

**ANDRE:** Could be hormonal. Could be stress. Could be a million things that have nothing to do with you.

**GARRETT:** Then why won't she do something about it? I suggested she talk to her doctor. She blew me off.

**ANDRE:** She probably doesn't see it as a medical issue.

**GARRETT:** But what if it is? What if her hormones are off or something? Wouldn't she want to know?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** Am I? Am I making too big a deal out of this?

**ANDRE:** I don't know, man. Sex is important in a relationship. But so is respecting your partner's boundaries.

**GARRETT:** I'm not crossing any boundaries. I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just expressing that I have needs too.

**ANDRE:** And what does she say when you express that?

**GARRETT:** She gets defensive. Says I'm making her feel bad about herself. That I'm pressuring her.

**ANDRE:** Are you pressuring her?

**GARRETT:** I don't think so. But maybe I am without realizing it. Like, if I bring it up too much, is that pressure?

**ANDRE:** Depends on how you bring it up.

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** Because to her, it probably feels like you're saying she's not doing enough.

**GARRETT:** But she's not. That's the problem. I'm not getting what I need from this relationship.

**ANDRE:** Okay, but have you asked her what she needs?

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** Like, maybe there's a reason she's not in the mood. Maybe there's something you could be doing differently that would help.

**GARRETT:** I've asked. She says she doesn't know. That she's just not feeling it.

**ANDRE:** That's frustrating.

**GARRETT:** Tell me about it. I'm trying to problem-solve here, and she won't even engage with the conversation.

**ANDRE:** Maybe she feels attacked. Like you're saying there's something wrong with her.

**GARRETT:** I'm not saying there's something wrong with her. I'm saying we have incompatible sex drives. That's not an attack, it's just a fact.

**ANDRE:** But the way you frame it matters. If you're coming at it like it's her fault, she's gonna shut down.

**GARRETT:** How else am I supposed to frame it? She's the one who's not interested.

**ANDRE:** See, that right there. You're making it about her not being interested. What if it's about you not creating the right environment for her to be interested?

**GARRETT:** What does that even mean?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. I'm not in your relationship. But maybe there's emotional stuff that needs to happen before physical stuff. For some people, that's how it works.

**GARRETT:** You think I'm not being emotionally available?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** Not in those exact words. But I've asked if she needs more romance or whatever. She said no.

**ANDRE:** What about stress? You said she's stressed. Is work bad right now?

**GARRETT:** Yeah, actually. She's been working late a lot. Her boss is kind of a nightmare.

**ANDRE:** So she comes home exhausted and you want to have sex. I can see how that might not line up.

**GARRETT:** I'm not jumping her the second she walks in the door. I give her space. But eventually, we need to connect. We can't just be two tired people living in the same apartment.

**ANDRE:** True. But if she's running on empty, sex might just feel like another obligation.

**GARRETT:** So what am I supposed to do? Just wait until her job gets better? That could be months. Years.

**ANDRE:** No, but you might need to adjust your expectations. And find other ways to feel connected that aren't sex.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Spending quality time together. Going on dates. Doing things she enjoys.

**GARRETT:** We do that stuff. We go out to dinner. We watch shows together. But it doesn't lead to anything physical.

**ANDRE:** Maybe it's not supposed to lead to anything. Maybe it's just about being together.

**GARRETT:** I hear you, but I need physical intimacy. That's a legitimate need.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**ANDRE:** No. You're supposed to figure out if this is something you can live with or not.

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**GARRETT:** What if she's fine with how things are? What if she doesn't see it as a problem?

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?

**ANDRE:** Not to this extent. But we've had conversations about it. There've been times when one of us wanted more and the other wasn't feeling it.

**ANDRE:** How did you work through it?

**ANDRE:** We just talked it out. Made sure we were both feeling heard. And we try to meet in the middle. Like, if she's not in the mood for full-on sex, maybe we do something else. Just to maintain that physical connection.

**GARRETT:** Taylor won't even do that. If she's not in the mood, that's it. Everything's off the table.

**ANDRE:** That's tough. Because you're right, you need some kind of physical intimacy. Even if it's not always sex.

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**ANDRE:** And you do respect it. But you're allowed to be frustrated about it.

**GARRETT:** Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to be frustrated. Like I'm supposed to just be understanding all the time.

**ANDRE:** You can be both. You can understand where she's coming from and still have your own feelings about it.

**GARRETT:** I just don't know how to fix this. We're stuck.

**ANDRE:** Maybe you need to have a bigger conversation. Not just about sex, but about the relationship as a whole. See if there are other issues hiding underneath.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** You might be onto something. Things have felt off in general lately. Not just the sex stuff.

**ANDRE:** There you go. Maybe start there. Talk about how you're both feeling about the relationship. See what comes up.

**GARRETT:** And if nothing comes up? If she says everything's fine except for my constant need for sex?

**ANDRE:** Then you're back to the same question. Can you live with this long-term or not?

**GARRETT:** I don't think I can. Not if it stays like this.

**ANDRE:** Then you might need to tell her that. Not as an ultimatum, but as honest communication about where you're at.

**GARRETT:** That's scary though. What if she says she can't change? Or won't change?

**ANDRE:** Then you have your answer. And you can make a decision from there.

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** I know. But you also can't stay in a relationship where you're constantly unsatisfied. That's not fair to either of you.

**GARRETT:** Yeah. You're right. I need to think about this more. Maybe talk to her this weekend when we actually have time.

**ANDRE:** Good idea. And go into it without expectations. Just be honest about how you're feeling.

**GARRETT:** I will. Thanks for talking this through with me. I know it's awkward.

**ANDRE:** It's not awkward. This is what friends do. We talk about the uncomfortable stuff.

**GARRETT:** Still. I appreciate it.

**ANDRE:** Anytime, man. Let me know how it goes.## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**GARRETT:** Can I ask you something kind of personal?

**ANDRE:** Yeah, man. What's up?

**GARRETT:** How often do you and Vanessa have sex?

**ANDRE:** Whoa. That's pretty direct.

**GARRETT:** I know. Sorry. You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out if what's happening with me and Taylor is normal or not.

**ANDRE:** What's happening?

**GARRETT:** We're just... not on the same page. Like, at all. When it comes to sex.

**ANDRE:** How so?

**GARRETT:** I want it way more than she does. And it's starting to become a problem.

**ANDRE:** Define way more.

**GARRETT:** I don't know. I'd be happy with three, four times a week. She's more like once a week. Maybe twice if I'm lucky.

**ANDRE:** And that's not enough for you?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** Am I? Am I making too big a deal out of this?

**ANDRE:** I don't know, man. Sex is important in a relationship. But so is respecting your partner's boundaries.

**GARRETT:** I'm not crossing any boundaries. I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just expressing that I have needs too.

**ANDRE:** And what does she say when you express that?

**GARRETT:** She gets defensive. Says I'm making her feel bad about herself. That I'm pressuring her.

**ANDRE:** Are you pressuring her?

**GARRETT:** I don't think so. But maybe I am without realizing it. Like, if I bring it up too much, is that pressure?

**ANDRE:** Depends on how you bring it up.

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** Because to her, it probably feels like you're saying she's not doing enough.

**GARRETT:** But she's not. That's the problem. I'm not getting what I need from this relationship.

**ANDRE:** Okay, but have you asked her what she needs?

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** Like, maybe there's a reason she's not in the mood. Maybe there's something you could be doing differently that would help.

**GARRETT:** I've asked. She says she doesn't know. That she's just not feeling it.

**ANDRE:** That's frustrating.

**GARRETT:** Tell me about it. I'm trying to problem-solve here, and she won't even engage with the conversation.

**ANDRE:** Maybe she feels attacked. Like you're saying there's something wrong with her.

**GARRETT:** I'm not saying there's something wrong with her. I'm saying we have incompatible sex drives. That's not an attack, it's just a fact.

**ANDRE:** But the way you frame it matters. If you're coming at it like it's her fault, she's gonna shut down.

**GARRETT:** How else am I supposed to frame it? She's the one who's not interested.

**ANDRE:** See, that right there. You're making it about her not being interested. What if it's about you not creating the right environment for her to be interested?

**GARRETT:** What does that even mean?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. I'm not in your relationship. But maybe there's emotional stuff that needs to happen before physical stuff. For some people, that's how it works.

**GARRETT:** You think I'm not being emotionally available?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** Not in those exact words. But I've asked if she needs more romance or whatever. She said no.

**ANDRE:** What about stress? You said she's stressed. Is work bad right now?

**GARRETT:** Yeah, actually. She's been working late a lot. Her boss is kind of a nightmare.

**ANDRE:** So she comes home exhausted and you want to have sex. I can see how that might not line up.

**GARRETT:** I'm not jumping her the second she walks in the door. I give her space. But eventually, we need to connect. We can't just be two tired people living in the same apartment.

**ANDRE:** True. But if she's running on empty, sex might just feel like another obligation.

**GARRETT:** So what am I supposed to do? Just wait until her job gets better? That could be months. Years.

**ANDRE:** No, but you might need to adjust your expectations. And find other ways to feel connected that aren't sex.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Spending quality time together. Going on dates. Doing things she enjoys.

**GARRETT:** We do that stuff. We go out to dinner. We watch shows together. But it doesn't lead to anything physical.

**ANDRE:** Maybe it's not supposed to lead to anything. Maybe it's just about being together.

**GARRETT:** I hear you, but I need physical intimacy. That's a legitimate need.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**ANDRE:** No. You're supposed to figure out if this is something you can live with or not.

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**GARRETT:** What if she's fine with how things are? What if she doesn't see it as a problem?

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?

**ANDRE:** Not to this extent. But we've had conversations about it. There've been times when one of us wanted more and the other wasn't feeling it.

**ANDRE:** How did you work through it?

**ANDRE:** We just talked it out. Made sure we were both feeling heard. And we try to meet in the middle. Like, if she's not in the mood for full-on sex, maybe we do something else. Just to maintain that physical connection.

**GARRETT:** Taylor won't even do that. If she's not in the mood, that's it. Everything's off the table.

**ANDRE:** That's tough. Because you're right, you need some kind of physical intimacy. Even if it's not always sex.

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**ANDRE:** And you do respect it. But you're allowed to be frustrated about it.

**GARRETT:** Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to be frustrated. Like I'm supposed to just be understanding all the time.

**ANDRE:** You can be both. You can understand where she's coming from and still have your own feelings about it.

**GARRETT:** I just don't know how to fix this. We're stuck.

**ANDRE:** Maybe you need to have a bigger conversation. Not just about sex, but about the relationship as a whole. See if there are other issues hiding underneath.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** You might be onto something. Things have felt off in general lately. Not just the sex stuff.

**ANDRE:** There you go. Maybe start there. Talk about how you're both feeling about the relationship. See what comes up.

**GARRETT:** And if nothing comes up? If she says everything's fine except for my constant need for sex?

**ANDRE:** Then you're back to the same question. Can you live with this long-term or not?

**GARRETT:** I don't think I can. Not if it stays like this.

**ANDRE:** Then you might need to tell her that. Not as an ultimatum, but as honest communication about where you're at.

**GARRETT:** That's scary though. What if she says she can't change? Or won't change?

**ANDRE:** Then you have your answer. And you can make a decision from there.

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** I know. But you also can't stay in a relationship where you're constantly unsatisfied. That's not fair to either of you.

**GARRETT:** Yeah. You're right. I need to think about this more. Maybe talk to her this weekend when we actually have time.

**ANDRE:** Good idea. And go into it without expectations. Just be honest about how you're feeling.

**GARRETT:** I will. Thanks for talking this through with me. I know it's awkward.

**ANDRE:** It's not awkward. This is what friends do. We talk about the uncomfortable stuff.

**GARRETT:** Still. I appreciate it.

**ANDRE:** Anytime, man. Let me know how it goes.## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**GARRETT:** Can I ask you something kind of personal?

**ANDRE:** Yeah, man. What's up?

**GARRETT:** How often do you and Vanessa have sex?

**ANDRE:** Whoa. That's pretty direct.

**GARRETT:** I know. Sorry. You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out if what's happening with me and Taylor is normal or not.

**ANDRE:** What's happening?

**GARRETT:** We're just... not on the same page. Like, at all. When it comes to sex.

**ANDRE:** How so?

**GARRETT:** I want it way more than she does. And it's starting to become a problem.

**ANDRE:** Define way more.

**GARRETT:** I don't know. I'd be happy with three, four times a week. She's more like once a week. Maybe twice if I'm lucky.

**ANDRE:** And that's not enough for you?

**GARRETT:** Not really. I mean, it's not just about the frequency. It's about feeling wanted. Connected. When we go a week without sex, I start to feel like we're just roommates.

**ANDRE:** Have you told her that?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. Multiple times. She says she's tired. Or stressed. Or not in the mood. And I get it. Life is busy. But it feels like there's always an excuse.

**ANDRE:** Does she ever initiate?

**GARRETT:** Almost never. It's always me. And half the time when I try, she shuts me down.

**ANDRE:** That's gotta be frustrating.

**GARRETT:** It's more than frustrating. It's starting to mess with my head. Like, am I not attractive to her anymore? Is she not into me?

**ANDRE:** What does she say when you ask her that?

**GARRETT:** She says of course she's attracted to me. That it has nothing to do with that. But I don't know, man. Actions speak louder than words.

**ANDRE:** Maybe her sex drive is just lower than yours. That's pretty common.

**GARRETT:** I know it's common. But how do you deal with it? How do you not take it personally?

**ANDRE:** I mean, Vanessa and I aren't exactly rabbits either. We probably average twice a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

**GARRETT:** And that works for both of you?

**ANDRE:** It works well enough. There are times I'd like more, but I'm not gonna pressure her if she's not feeling it.

**GARRETT:** See, that's where I struggle. I don't want to pressure her. But I also don't want to just accept a sexless relationship.

**ANDRE:** Once a week isn't sexless.

**GARRETT:** It feels like it to me. Especially when I think about how things used to be.

**ANDRE:** What do you mean?

**GARRETT:** When we first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We'd have sex multiple times a day sometimes. It was intense.

**ANDRE:** That's the honeymoon phase, dude. It always slows down.

**GARRETT:** I know. But this feels like more than slowing down. This feels like stopping.

**ANDRE:** How long have you guys been together now?

**GARRETT:** Three years. We moved in together about six months ago.

**ANDRE:** And when did the sex drop off?

**GARRETT:** Pretty much right after we moved in. At first I thought it was just the stress of the move. But it's been six months and nothing's changed.

**ANDRE:** Did something happen? Like a specific incident?

**GARRETT:** Not that I know of. We didn't have a fight or anything. It just gradually became less frequent.

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. She says everything's fine. That she's just not as sexual as she used to be. Which makes me feel great, by the way.

**ANDRE:** I'm sure she didn't mean it like that.

**GARRETT:** Maybe not. But that's how it landed. Like, our relationship made her less interested in sex. How is that not a red flag?

**ANDRE:** Could be hormonal. Could be stress. Could be a million things that have nothing to do with you.

**GARRETT:** Then why won't she do something about it? I suggested she talk to her doctor. She blew me off.

**ANDRE:** She probably doesn't see it as a medical issue.

**GARRETT:** But what if it is? What if her hormones are off or something? Wouldn't she want to know?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** So what am I supposed to do? Just wait until her job gets better? That could be months. Years.

**ANDRE:** No, but you might need to adjust your expectations. And find other ways to feel connected that aren't sex.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Spending quality time together. Going on dates. Doing things she enjoys.

**GARRETT:** We do that stuff. We go out to dinner. We watch shows together. But it doesn't lead to anything physical.

**ANDRE:** Maybe it's not supposed to lead to anything. Maybe it's just about being together.

**GARRETT:** I hear you, but I need physical intimacy. That's a legitimate need.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**ANDRE:** No. You're supposed to figure out if this is something you can live with or not.

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**GARRETT:** What if she's fine with how things are? What if she doesn't see it as a problem?

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?

**ANDRE:** Not to this extent. But we've had conversations about it. There've been times when one of us wanted more and the other wasn't feeling it.

**ANDRE:** How did you work through it?

**ANDRE:** We just talked it out. Made sure we were both feeling heard. And we try to meet in the middle. Like, if she's not in the mood for full-on sex, maybe we do something else. Just to maintain that physical connection.

**GARRETT:** Taylor won't even do that. If she's not in the mood, that's it. Everything's off the table.

**ANDRE:** That's tough. Because you're right, you need some kind of physical intimacy. Even if it's not always sex.

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**ANDRE:** And you do respect it. But you're allowed to be frustrated about it.

**GARRETT:** Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to be frustrated. Like I'm supposed to just be understanding all the time.

**ANDRE:** You can be both. You can understand where she's coming from and still have your own feelings about it.

**GARRETT:** I just don't know how to fix this. We're stuck.

**ANDRE:** Maybe you need to have a bigger conversation. Not just about sex, but about the relationship as a whole. See if there are other issues hiding underneath.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** You might be onto something. Things have felt off in general lately. Not just the sex stuff.

**ANDRE:** There you go. Maybe start there. Talk about how you're both feeling about the relationship. See what comes up.

**GARRETT:** And if nothing comes up? If she says everything's fine except for my constant need for sex?

**ANDRE:** Then you're back to the same question. Can you live with this long-term or not?

**GARRETT:** I don't think I can. Not if it stays like this.

**ANDRE:** Then you might need to tell her that. Not as an ultimatum, but as honest communication about where you're at.

**GARRETT:** That's scary though. What if she says she can't change? Or won't change?

**ANDRE:** Then you have your answer. And you can make a decision from there.

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** I know. But you also can't stay in a relationship where you're constantly unsatisfied. That's not fair to either of you.

**GARRETT:** Yeah. You're right. I need to think about this more. Maybe talk to her this weekend when we actually have time.

**ANDRE:** Good idea. And go into it without expectations. Just be honest about how you're feeling.

**GARRETT:** I will. Thanks for talking this through with me. I know it's awkward.

**ANDRE:** It's not awkward. This is what friends do. We talk about the uncomfortable stuff.

**GARRETT:** Still. I appreciate it.

**ANDRE:** Anytime, man. Let me know how it goes.## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**GARRETT:** Can I ask you something kind of personal?

**ANDRE:** Yeah, man. What's up?

**GARRETT:** How often do you and Vanessa have sex?

**ANDRE:** Whoa. That's pretty direct.

**GARRETT:** I know. Sorry. You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out if what's happening with me and Taylor is normal or not.

**ANDRE:** What's happening?

**GARRETT:** We're just... not on the same page. Like, at all. When it comes to sex.

**ANDRE:** How so?

**GARRETT:** I want it way more than she does. And it's starting to become a problem.

**ANDRE:** Define way more.

**GARRETT:** I don't know. I'd be happy with three, four times a week. She's more like once a week. Maybe twice if I'm lucky.

**ANDRE:** And that's not enough for you?

**GARRETT:** Not really. I mean, it's not just about the frequency. It's about feeling wanted. Connected. When we go a week without sex, I start to feel like we're just roommates.

**ANDRE:** Have you told her that?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. Multiple times. She says she's tired. Or stressed. Or not in the mood. And I get it. Life is busy. But it feels like there's always an excuse.

**ANDRE:** Does she ever initiate?

**GARRETT:** Almost never. It's always me. And half the time when I try, she shuts me down.

**ANDRE:** That's gotta be frustrating.

**GARRETT:** It's more than frustrating. It's starting to mess with my head. Like, am I not attractive to her anymore? Is she not into me?

**ANDRE:** What does she say when you ask her that?

**GARRETT:** She says of course she's attracted to me. That it has nothing to do with that. But I don't know, man. Actions speak louder than words.

**ANDRE:** Maybe her sex drive is just lower than yours. That's pretty common.

**GARRETT:** I know it's common. But how do you deal with it? How do you not take it personally?

**ANDRE:** I mean, Vanessa and I aren't exactly rabbits either. We probably average twice a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

**GARRETT:** And that works for both of you?

**ANDRE:** It works well enough. There are times I'd like more, but I'm not gonna pressure her if she's not feeling it.

**GARRETT:** See, that's where I struggle. I don't want to pressure her. But I also don't want to just accept a sexless relationship.

**ANDRE:** Once a week isn't sexless.

**GARRETT:** It feels like it to me. Especially when I think about how things used to be.

**ANDRE:** What do you mean?

**GARRETT:** When we first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We'd have sex multiple times a day sometimes. It was intense.

**ANDRE:** That's the honeymoon phase, dude. It always slows down.

**GARRETT:** I know. But this feels like more than slowing down. This feels like stopping.

**ANDRE:** How long have you guys been together now?

**GARRETT:** Three years. We moved in together about six months ago.

**ANDRE:** And when did the sex drop off?

**GARRETT:** Pretty much right after we moved in. At first I thought it was just the stress of the move. But it's been six months and nothing's changed.

**ANDRE:** Did something happen? Like a specific incident?

**GARRETT:** Not that I know of. We didn't have a fight or anything. It just gradually became less frequent.

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. She says everything's fine. That she's just not as sexual as she used to be. Which makes me feel great, by the way.

**ANDRE:** I'm sure she didn't mean it like that.

**GARRETT:** Maybe not. But that's how it landed. Like, our relationship made her less interested in sex. How is that not a red flag?

**ANDRE:** Could be hormonal. Could be stress. Could be a million things that have nothing to do with you.

**GARRETT:** Then why won't she do something about it? I suggested she talk to her doctor. She blew me off.

**ANDRE:** She probably doesn't see it as a medical issue.

**GARRETT:** But what if it is? What if her hormones are off or something? Wouldn't she want to know?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** Am I? Am I making too big a deal out of this?

**ANDRE:** I don't know, man. Sex is important in a relationship. But so is respecting your partner's boundaries.

**GARRETT:** I'm not crossing any boundaries. I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just expressing that I have needs too.

**ANDRE:** And what does she say when you express that?

**GARRETT:** She gets defensive. Says I'm making her feel bad about herself. That I'm pressuring her.

**ANDRE:** Are you pressuring her?

**GARRETT:** I don't think so. But maybe I am without realizing it. Like, if I bring it up too much, is that pressure?

**ANDRE:** Depends on how you bring it up.

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** Because to her, it probably feels like you're saying she's not doing enough.

**GARRETT:** But she's not. That's the problem. I'm not getting what I need from this relationship.

**ANDRE:** Okay, but have you asked her what she needs?

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** Like, maybe there's a reason she's not in the mood. Maybe there's something you could be doing differently that would help.

**GARRETT:** I've asked. She says she doesn't know. That she's just not feeling it.

**ANDRE:** That's frustrating.

**GARRETT:** Tell me about it. I'm trying to problem-solve here, and she won't even engage with the conversation.

**ANDRE:** Maybe she feels attacked. Like you're saying there's something wrong with her.

**GARRETT:** I'm not saying there's something wrong with her. I'm saying we have incompatible sex drives. That's not an attack, it's just a fact.

**ANDRE:** But the way you frame it matters. If you're coming at it like it's her fault, she's gonna shut down.

**GARRETT:** How else am I supposed to frame it? She's the one who's not interested.

**ANDRE:** See, that right there. You're making it about her not being interested. What if it's about you not creating the right environment for her to be interested?

**GARRETT:** What does that even mean?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. I'm not in your relationship. But maybe there's emotional stuff that needs to happen before physical stuff. For some people, that's how it works.

**GARRETT:** You think I'm not being emotionally available?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** Not in those exact words. But I've asked if she needs more romance or whatever. She said no.

**ANDRE:** What about stress? You said she's stressed. Is work bad right now?

**GARRETT:** Yeah, actually. She's been working late a lot. Her boss is kind of a nightmare.

**ANDRE:** So she comes home exhausted and you want to have sex. I can see how that might not line up.

**GARRETT:** I'm not jumping her the second she walks in the door. I give her space. But eventually, we need to connect. We can't just be two tired people living in the same apartment.

**ANDRE:** True. But if she's running on empty, sex might just feel like another obligation.

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** You might be onto something. Things have felt off in general lately. Not just the sex stuff.

**ANDRE:** There you go. Maybe start there. Talk about how you're both feeling about the relationship. See what comes up.

**GARRETT:** And if nothing comes up? If she says everything's fine except for my constant need for sex?

**ANDRE:** Then you're back to the same question. Can you live with this long-term or not?

**GARRETT:** I don't think I can. Not if it stays like this.

**ANDRE:** Then you might need to tell her that. Not as an ultimatum, but as honest communication about where you're at.

**GARRETT:** That's scary though. What if she says she can't change? Or won't change?

**ANDRE:** Then you have your answer. And you can make a decision from there.

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** I know. But you also can't stay in a relationship where you're constantly unsatisfied. That's not fair to either of you.

**GARRETT:** Yeah. You're right. I need to think about this more. Maybe talk to her this weekend when we actually have time.

**ANDRE:** Good idea. And go into it without expectations. Just be honest about how you're feeling.

**GARRETT:** I will. Thanks for talking this through with me. I know it's awkward.

**ANDRE:** It's not awkward. This is what friends do. We talk about the uncomfortable stuff.

**GARRETT:** Still. I appreciate it.

**ANDRE:** Anytime, man. Let me know how it goes.## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**GARRETT:** Can I ask you something kind of personal?

**ANDRE:** Yeah, man. What's up?

**GARRETT:** How often do you and Vanessa have sex?

**ANDRE:** Whoa. That's pretty direct.

**GARRETT:** I know. Sorry. You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out if what's happening with me and Taylor is normal or not.

**ANDRE:** What's happening?

**GARRETT:** We're just... not on the same page. Like, at all. When it comes to sex.

**ANDRE:** How so?

**GARRETT:** I want it way more than she does. And it's starting to become a problem.

**ANDRE:** Define way more.

**GARRETT:** I don't know. I'd be happy with three, four times a week. She's more like once a week. Maybe twice if I'm lucky.

**ANDRE:** And that's not enough for you?

**GARRETT:** Not really. I mean, it's not just about the frequency. It's about feeling wanted. Connected. When we go a week without sex, I start to feel like we're just roommates.

**ANDRE:** Have you told her that?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. Multiple times. She says she's tired. Or stressed. Or not in the mood. And I get it. Life is busy. But it feels like there's always an excuse.

**ANDRE:** Does she ever initiate?

**GARRETT:** Almost never. It's always me. And half the time when I try, she shuts me down.

**ANDRE:** That's gotta be frustrating.

**GARRETT:** It's more than frustrating. It's starting to mess with my head. Like, am I not attractive to her anymore? Is she not into me?

**ANDRE:** What does she say when you ask her that?

**GARRETT:** She says of course she's attracted to me. That it has nothing to do with that. But I don't know, man. Actions speak louder than words.

**ANDRE:** Maybe her sex drive is just lower than yours. That's pretty common.

**GARRETT:** I know it's common. But how do you deal with it? How do you not take it personally?

**ANDRE:** I mean, Vanessa and I aren't exactly rabbits either. We probably average twice a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

**GARRETT:** And that works for both of you?

**ANDRE:** It works well enough. There are times I'd like more, but I'm not gonna pressure her if she's not feeling it.

**GARRETT:** See, that's where I struggle. I don't want to pressure her. But I also don't want to just accept a sexless relationship.

**ANDRE:** Once a week isn't sexless.

**GARRETT:** It feels like it to me. Especially when I think about how things used to be.

**ANDRE:** What do you mean?

**GARRETT:** When we first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We'd have sex multiple times a day sometimes. It was intense.

**ANDRE:** That's the honeymoon phase, dude. It always slows down.

**GARRETT:** I know. But this feels like more than slowing down. This feels like stopping.

**ANDRE:** How long have you guys been together now?

**GARRETT:** Three years. We moved in together about six months ago.

**ANDRE:** And when did the sex drop off?

**GARRETT:** Pretty much right after we moved in. At first I thought it was just the stress of the move. But it's been six months and nothing's changed.

**ANDRE:** Did something happen? Like a specific incident?

**GARRETT:** Not that I know of. We didn't have a fight or anything. It just gradually became less frequent.

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. She says everything's fine. That she's just not as sexual as she used to be. Which makes me feel great, by the way.

**ANDRE:** I'm sure she didn't mean it like that.

**GARRETT:** Maybe not. But that's how it landed. Like, our relationship made her less interested in sex. How is that not a red flag?

**ANDRE:** Could be hormonal. Could be stress. Could be a million things that have nothing to do with you.

**GARRETT:** Then why won't she do something about it? I suggested she talk to her doctor. She blew me off.

**ANDRE:** She probably doesn't see it as a medical issue.

**GARRETT:** But what if it is? What if her hormones are off or something? Wouldn't she want to know?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** Am I? Am I making too big a deal out of this?

**ANDRE:** I don't know, man. Sex is important in a relationship. But so is respecting your partner's boundaries.

**GARRETT:** I'm not crossing any boundaries. I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just expressing that I have needs too.

**ANDRE:** And what does she say when you express that?

**GARRETT:** She gets defensive. Says I'm making her feel bad about herself. That I'm pressuring her.

**ANDRE:** Are you pressuring her?

**GARRETT:** I don't think so. But maybe I am without realizing it. Like, if I bring it up too much, is that pressure?

**ANDRE:** Depends on how you bring it up.

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** Because to her, it probably feels like you're saying she's not doing enough.

**GARRETT:** But she's not. That's the problem. I'm not getting what I need from this relationship.

**ANDRE:** Okay, but have you asked her what she needs?

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** Like, maybe there's a reason she's not in the mood. Maybe there's something you could be doing differently that would help.

**GARRETT:** I've asked. She says she doesn't know. That she's just not feeling it.

**ANDRE:** That's frustrating.

**GARRETT:** Tell me about it. I'm trying to problem-solve here, and she won't even engage with the conversation.

**ANDRE:** Maybe she feels attacked. Like you're saying there's something wrong with her.

**GARRETT:** I'm not saying there's something wrong with her. I'm saying we have incompatible sex drives. That's not an attack, it's just a fact.

**ANDRE:** But the way you frame it matters. If you're coming at it like it's her fault, she's gonna shut down.

**GARRETT:** How else am I supposed to frame it? She's the one who's not interested.

**ANDRE:** See, that right there. You're making it about her not being interested. What if it's about you not creating the right environment for her to be interested?

**GARRETT:** What does that even mean?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. I'm not in your relationship. But maybe there's emotional stuff that needs to happen before physical stuff. For some people, that's how it works.

**GARRETT:** You think I'm not being emotionally available?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** Not in those exact words. But I've asked if she needs more romance or whatever. She said no.

**ANDRE:** What about stress? You said she's stressed. Is work bad right now?

**GARRETT:** Yeah, actually. She's been working late a lot. Her boss is kind of a nightmare.

**ANDRE:** So she comes home exhausted and you want to have sex. I can see how that might not line up.

**GARRETT:** I'm not jumping her the second she walks in the door. I give her space. But eventually, we need to connect. We can't just be two tired people living in the same apartment.

**ANDRE:** True. But if she's running on empty, sex might just feel like another obligation.

**GARRETT:** So what am I supposed to do? Just wait until her job gets better? That could be months. Years.

**ANDRE:** No, but you might need to adjust your expectations. And find other ways to feel connected that aren't sex.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Spending quality time together. Going on dates. Doing things she enjoys.

**GARRETT:** We do that stuff. We go out to dinner. We watch shows together. But it doesn't lead to anything physical.

**ANDRE:** Maybe it's not supposed to lead to anything. Maybe it's just about being together.

**GARRETT:** I hear you, but I need physical intimacy. That's a legitimate need.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**ANDRE:** No. You're supposed to figure out if this is something you can live with or not.

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**GARRETT:** What if she's fine with how things are? What if she doesn't see it as a problem?

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?

**ANDRE:** Not to this extent. But we've had conversations about it. There've been times when one of us wanted more and the other wasn't feeling it.

**ANDRE:** How did you work through it?

**ANDRE:** We just talked it out. Made sure we were both feeling heard. And we try to meet in the middle. Like, if she's not in the mood for full-on sex, maybe we do something else. Just to maintain that physical connection.

**GARRETT:** Taylor won't even do that. If she's not in the mood, that's it. Everything's off the table.

**ANDRE:** That's tough. Because you're right, you need some kind of physical intimacy. Even if it's not always sex.

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**ANDRE:** And you do respect it. But you're allowed to be frustrated about it.

**GARRETT:** Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to be frustrated. Like I'm supposed to just be understanding all the time.

**ANDRE:** You can be both. You can understand where she's coming from and still have your own feelings about it.

**GARRETT:** I just don't know how to fix this. We're stuck.

**ANDRE:** Maybe you need to have a bigger conversation. Not just about sex, but about the relationship as a whole. See if there are other issues hiding underneath.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** She says of course she's attracted to me. That it has nothing to do with that. But I don't know, man. Actions speak louder than words.

**ANDRE:** Maybe her sex drive is just lower than yours. That's pretty common.

**GARRETT:** I know it's common. But how do you deal with it? How do you not take it personally?

**ANDRE:** I mean, Vanessa and I aren't exactly rabbits either. We probably average twice a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

**GARRETT:** And that works for both of you?

**ANDRE:** It works well enough. There are times I'd like more, but I'm not gonna pressure her if she's not feeling it.

**GARRETT:** See, that's where I struggle. I don't want to pressure her. But I also don't want to just accept a sexless relationship.

**ANDRE:** Once a week isn't sexless.

**GARRETT:** It feels like it to me. Especially when I think about how things used to be.

**ANDRE:** What do you mean?

**GARRETT:** When we first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We'd have sex multiple times a day sometimes. It was intense.

**ANDRE:** That's the honeymoon phase, dude. It always slows down.

**GARRETT:** I know. But this feels like more than slowing down. This feels like stopping.

**ANDRE:** How long have you guys been together now?

**GARRETT:** Three years. We moved in together about six months ago.

**ANDRE:** And when did the sex drop off?

**GARRETT:** Pretty much right after we moved in. At first I thought it was just the stress of the move. But it's been six months and nothing's changed.

**ANDRE:** Did something happen? Like a specific incident?

**GARRETT:** Not that I know of. We didn't have a fight or anything. It just gradually became less frequent.

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. She says everything's fine. That she's just not as sexual as she used to be. Which makes me feel great, by the way.

**ANDRE:** I'm sure she didn't mean it like that.

**GARRETT:** Maybe not. But that's how it landed. Like, our relationship made her less interested in sex. How is that not a red flag?

**ANDRE:** Could be hormonal. Could be stress. Could be a million things that have nothing to do with you.

**GARRETT:** Then why won't she do something about it? I suggested she talk to her doctor. She blew me off.

**ANDRE:** She probably doesn't see it as a medical issue.

**GARRETT:** But what if it is? What if her hormones are off or something? Wouldn't she want to know?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** Am I? Am I making too big a deal out of this?

**ANDRE:** I don't know, man. Sex is important in a relationship. But so is respecting your partner's boundaries.

**GARRETT:** I'm not crossing any boundaries. I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just expressing that I have needs too.

**ANDRE:** And what does she say when you express that?

**GARRETT:** She gets defensive. Says I'm making her feel bad about herself. That I'm pressuring her.

**ANDRE:** Are you pressuring her?

**GARRETT:** I don't think so. But maybe I am without realizing it. Like, if I bring it up too much, is that pressure?

**ANDRE:** Depends on how you bring it up.

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** Because to her, it probably feels like you're saying she's not doing enough.

**GARRETT:** But she's not. That's the problem. I'm not getting what I need from this relationship.

**ANDRE:** Okay, but have you asked her what she needs?

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** Like, maybe there's a reason she's not in the mood. Maybe there's something you could be doing differently that would help.

**GARRETT:** I've asked. She says she doesn't know. That she's just not feeling it.

**ANDRE:** That's frustrating.

**GARRETT:** Tell me about it. I'm trying to problem-solve here, and she won't even engage with the conversation.

**ANDRE:** Maybe she feels attacked. Like you're saying there's something wrong with her.

**GARRETT:** I'm not saying there's something wrong with her. I'm saying we have incompatible sex drives. That's not an attack, it's just a fact.

**ANDRE:** But the way you frame it matters. If you're coming at it like it's her fault, she's gonna shut down.

**GARRETT:** How else am I supposed to frame it? She's the one who's not interested.

**ANDRE:** See, that right there. You're making it about her not being interested. What if it's about you not creating the right environment for her to be interested?

**GARRETT:** What does that even mean?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. I'm not in your relationship. But maybe there's emotional stuff that needs to happen before physical stuff. For some people, that's how it works.

**GARRETT:** You think I'm not being emotionally available?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** Not in those exact words. But I've asked if she needs more romance or whatever. She said no.

**ANDRE:** What about stress? You said she's stressed. Is work bad right now?

**GARRETT:** Yeah, actually. She's been working late a lot. Her boss is kind of a nightmare.

**ANDRE:** So she comes home exhausted and you want to have sex. I can see how that might not line up.

**GARRETT:** I'm not jumping her the second she walks in the door. I give her space. But eventually, we need to connect. We can't just be two tired people living in the same apartment.

**ANDRE:** True. But if she's running on empty, sex might just feel like another obligation.

**GARRETT:** So what am I supposed to do? Just wait until her job gets better? That could be months. Years.

**ANDRE:** No, but you might need to adjust your expectations. And find other ways to feel connected that aren't sex.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Spending quality time together. Going on dates. Doing things she enjoys.

**GARRETT:** We do that stuff. We go out to dinner. We watch shows together. But it doesn't lead to anything physical.

**ANDRE:** Maybe it's not supposed to lead to anything. Maybe it's just about being together.

**GARRETT:** I hear you, but I need physical intimacy. That's a legitimate need.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**ANDRE:** No. You're supposed to figure out if this is something you can live with or not.

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**GARRETT:** What if she's fine with how things are? What if she doesn't see it as a problem?

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?

**ANDRE:** Not to this extent. But we've had conversations about it. There've been times when one of us wanted more and the other wasn't feeling it.

**ANDRE:** How did you work through it?

**ANDRE:** We just talked it out. Made sure we were both feeling heard. And we try to meet in the middle. Like, if she's not in the mood for full-on sex, maybe we do something else. Just to maintain that physical connection.

**GARRETT:** Taylor won't even do that. If she's not in the mood, that's it. Everything's off the table.

**ANDRE:** That's tough. Because you're right, you need some kind of physical intimacy. Even if it's not always sex.

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**ANDRE:** And you do respect it. But you're allowed to be frustrated about it.

**GARRETT:** Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to be frustrated. Like I'm supposed to just be understanding all the time.

**ANDRE:** You can be both. You can understand where she's coming from and still have your own feelings about it.

**GARRETT:** I just don't know how to fix this. We're stuck.

**ANDRE:** Maybe you need to have a bigger conversation. Not just about sex, but about the relationship as a whole. See if there are other issues hiding underneath.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** You might be onto something. Things have felt off in general lately. Not just the sex stuff.

**ANDRE:** There you go. Maybe start there. Talk about how you're both feeling about the relationship. See what comes up.

**GARRETT:** And if nothing comes up? If she says everything's fine except for my constant need for sex?

**ANDRE:** Then you're back to the same question. Can you live with this long-term or not?

**GARRETT:** I don't think I can. Not if it stays like this.

**ANDRE:** Then you might need to tell her that. Not as an ultimatum, but as honest communication about where you're at.

**GARRETT:** That's scary though. What if she says she can't change? Or won't change?

**ANDRE:** Then you have your answer. And you can make a decision from there.

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** I know. But you also can't stay in a relationship where you're constantly unsatisfied. That's not fair to either of you.

**GARRETT:** Yeah. You're right. I need to think about this more. Maybe talk to her this weekend when we actually have time.

**ANDRE:** Good idea. And go into it without expectations. Just be honest about how you're feeling.

**GARRETT:** I will. Thanks for talking this through with me. I know it's awkward.

**ANDRE:** It's not awkward. This is what friends do. We talk about the uncomfortable stuff.

**GARRETT:** Still. I appreciate it.

**ANDRE:** Anytime, man. Let me know how it goes.## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**GARRETT:** Can I ask you something kind of personal?

**ANDRE:** Yeah, man. What's up?

**GARRETT:** How often do you and Vanessa have sex?

**ANDRE:** Whoa. That's pretty direct.

**GARRETT:** I know. Sorry. You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out if what's happening with me and Taylor is normal or not.

**ANDRE:** What's happening?

**GARRETT:** We're just... not on the same page. Like, at all. When it comes to sex.

**ANDRE:** How so?

**GARRETT:** I want it way more than she does. And it's starting to become a problem.

**ANDRE:** Define way more.

**GARRETT:** I don't know. I'd be happy with three, four times a week. She's more like once a week. Maybe twice if I'm lucky.

**ANDRE:** And that's not enough for you?

**GARRETT:** Not really. I mean, it's not just about the frequency. It's about feeling wanted. Connected. When we go a week without sex, I start to feel like we're just roommates.

**ANDRE:** Have you told her that?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. Multiple times. She says she's tired. Or stressed. Or not in the mood. And I get it. Life is busy. But it feels like there's always an excuse.

**ANDRE:** Does she ever initiate?

**GARRETT:** Almost never. It's always me. And half the time when I try, she shuts me down.

**ANDRE:** That's gotta be frustrating.

**GARRETT:** It's more than frustrating. It's starting to mess with my head. Like, am I not attractive to her anymore? Is she not into me?

**ANDRE:** What does she say when you ask her that?

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** Because to her, it probably feels like you're saying she's not doing enough.

**GARRETT:** But she's not. That's the problem. I'm not getting what I need from this relationship.

**ANDRE:** Okay, but have you asked her what she needs?

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** Like, maybe there's a reason she's not in the mood. Maybe there's something you could be doing differently that would help.

**GARRETT:** I've asked. She says she doesn't know. That she's just not feeling it.

**ANDRE:** That's frustrating.

**GARRETT:** Tell me about it. I'm trying to problem-solve here, and she won't even engage with the conversation.

**ANDRE:** Maybe she feels attacked. Like you're saying there's something wrong with her.

**GARRETT:** I'm not saying there's something wrong with her. I'm saying we have incompatible sex drives. That's not an attack, it's just a fact.

**ANDRE:** But the way you frame it matters. If you're coming at it like it's her fault, she's gonna shut down.

**GARRETT:** How else am I supposed to frame it? She's the one who's not interested.

**ANDRE:** See, that right there. You're making it about her not being interested. What if it's about you not creating the right environment for her to be interested?

**GARRETT:** What does that even mean?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. I'm not in your relationship. But maybe there's emotional stuff that needs to happen before physical stuff. For some people, that's how it works.

**GARRETT:** You think I'm not being emotionally available?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** Not in those exact words. But I've asked if she needs more romance or whatever. She said no.

**ANDRE:** What about stress? You said she's stressed. Is work bad right now?

**GARRETT:** Yeah, actually. She's been working late a lot. Her boss is kind of a nightmare.

**ANDRE:** So she comes home exhausted and you want to have sex. I can see how that might not line up.

**GARRETT:** I'm not jumping her the second she walks in the door. I give her space. But eventually, we need to connect. We can't just be two tired people living in the same apartment.

**ANDRE:** True. But if she's running on empty, sex might just feel like another obligation.

**GARRETT:** So what am I supposed to do? Just wait until her job gets better? That could be months. Years.

**ANDRE:** No, but you might need to adjust your expectations. And find other ways to feel connected that aren't sex.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Spending quality time together. Going on dates. Doing things she enjoys.

**GARRETT:** We do that stuff. We go out to dinner. We watch shows together. But it doesn't lead to anything physical.

**ANDRE:** Maybe it's not supposed to lead to anything. Maybe it's just about being together.

**GARRETT:** I hear you, but I need physical intimacy. That's a legitimate need.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**ANDRE:** No. You're supposed to figure out if this is something you can live with or not.

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**GARRETT:** What if she's fine with how things are? What if she doesn't see it as a problem?

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?

**ANDRE:** Not to this extent. But we've had conversations about it. There've been times when one of us wanted more and the other wasn't feeling it.

**ANDRE:** How did you work through it?

**ANDRE:** We just talked it out. Made sure we were both feeling heard. And we try to meet in the middle. Like, if she's not in the mood for full-on sex, maybe we do something else. Just to maintain that physical connection.

**GARRETT:** Taylor won't even do that. If she's not in the mood, that's it. Everything's off the table.

**ANDRE:** That's tough. Because you're right, you need some kind of physical intimacy. Even if it's not always sex.

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**ANDRE:** And you do respect it. But you're allowed to be frustrated about it.

**GARRETT:** Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to be frustrated. Like I'm supposed to just be understanding all the time.

**ANDRE:** You can be both. You can understand where she's coming from and still have your own feelings about it.

**GARRETT:** I just don't know how to fix this. We're stuck.

**ANDRE:** Maybe you need to have a bigger conversation. Not just about sex, but about the relationship as a whole. See if there are other issues hiding underneath.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** You might be onto something. Things have felt off in general lately. Not just the sex stuff.

**ANDRE:** There you go. Maybe start there. Talk about how you're both feeling about the relationship. See what comes up.

**GARRETT:** And if nothing comes up? If she says everything's fine except for my constant need for sex?

**ANDRE:** Then you're back to the same question. Can you live with this long-term or not?

**GARRETT:** I don't think I can. Not if it stays like this.

**ANDRE:** Then you might need to tell her that. Not as an ultimatum, but as honest communication about where you're at.

**GARRETT:** That's scary though. What if she says she can't change? Or won't change?

**ANDRE:** Then you have your answer. And you can make a decision from there.

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** I know. But you also can't stay in a relationship where you're constantly unsatisfied. That's not fair to either of you.

**GARRETT:** Yeah. You're right. I need to think about this more. Maybe talk to her this weekend when we actually have time.

**ANDRE:** Good idea. And go into it without expectations. Just be honest about how you're feeling.

**GARRETT:** I will. Thanks for talking this through with me. I know it's awkward.

**ANDRE:** It's not awkward. This is what friends do. We talk about the uncomfortable stuff.

**GARRETT:** Still. I appreciate it.

**ANDRE:** Anytime, man. Let me know how it goes.## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**GARRETT:** Can I ask you something kind of personal?

**ANDRE:** Yeah, man. What's up?

**GARRETT:** How often do you and Vanessa have sex?

**ANDRE:** Whoa. That's pretty direct.

**GARRETT:** I know. Sorry. You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out if what's happening with me and Taylor is normal or not.

**ANDRE:** What's happening?

**GARRETT:** We're just... not on the same page. Like, at all. When it comes to sex.

**ANDRE:** How so?

**GARRETT:** I want it way more than she does. And it's starting to become a problem.

**ANDRE:** Define way more.

**GARRETT:** I don't know. I'd be happy with three, four times a week. She's more like once a week. Maybe twice if I'm lucky.

**ANDRE:** And that's not enough for you?

**GARRETT:** Not really. I mean, it's not just about the frequency. It's about feeling wanted. Connected. When we go a week without sex, I start to feel like we're just roommates.

**ANDRE:** Have you told her that?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. Multiple times. She says she's tired. Or stressed. Or not in the mood. And I get it. Life is busy. But it feels like there's always an excuse.

**ANDRE:** Does she ever initiate?

**GARRETT:** Almost never. It's always me. And half the time when I try, she shuts me down.

**ANDRE:** That's gotta be frustrating.

**GARRETT:** It's more than frustrating. It's starting to mess with my head. Like, am I not attractive to her anymore? Is she not into me?

**ANDRE:** What does she say when you ask her that?

**GARRETT:** She says of course she's attracted to me. That it has nothing to do with that. But I don't know, man. Actions speak louder than words.

**ANDRE:** Maybe her sex drive is just lower than yours. That's pretty common.

**GARRETT:** I know it's common. But how do you deal with it? How do you not take it personally?

**ANDRE:** I mean, Vanessa and I aren't exactly rabbits either. We probably average twice a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

**GARRETT:** And that works for both of you?

**ANDRE:** It works well enough. There are times I'd like more, but I'm not gonna pressure her if she's not feeling it.

**GARRETT:** See, that's where I struggle. I don't want to pressure her. But I also don't want to just accept a sexless relationship.

**ANDRE:** Once a week isn't sexless.

**GARRETT:** It feels like it to me. Especially when I think about how things used to be.

**ANDRE:** What do you mean?

**GARRETT:** When we first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We'd have sex multiple times a day sometimes. It was intense.

**ANDRE:** That's the honeymoon phase, dude. It always slows down.

**GARRETT:** I know. But this feels like more than slowing down. This feels like stopping.

**ANDRE:** How long have you guys been together now?

**GARRETT:** Three years. We moved in together about six months ago.

**ANDRE:** And when did the sex drop off?

**GARRETT:** Pretty much right after we moved in. At first I thought it was just the stress of the move. But it's been six months and nothing's changed.

**ANDRE:** Did something happen? Like a specific incident?

**GARRETT:** Not that I know of. We didn't have a fight or anything. It just gradually became less frequent.

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. She says everything's fine. That she's just not as sexual as she used to be. Which makes me feel great, by the way.

**ANDRE:** I'm sure she didn't mean it like that.

**GARRETT:** Maybe not. But that's how it landed. Like, our relationship made her less interested in sex. How is that not a red flag?

**ANDRE:** Could be hormonal. Could be stress. Could be a million things that have nothing to do with you.

**GARRETT:** Then why won't she do something about it? I suggested she talk to her doctor. She blew me off.

**ANDRE:** She probably doesn't see it as a medical issue.

**GARRETT:** But what if it is? What if her hormones are off or something? Wouldn't she want to know?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** Am I? Am I making too big a deal out of this?

**ANDRE:** I don't know, man. Sex is important in a relationship. But so is respecting your partner's boundaries.

**GARRETT:** I'm not crossing any boundaries. I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just expressing that I have needs too.

**ANDRE:** And what does she say when you express that?

**GARRETT:** She gets defensive. Says I'm making her feel bad about herself. That I'm pressuring her.

**ANDRE:** Are you pressuring her?

**GARRETT:** I don't think so. But maybe I am without realizing it. Like, if I bring it up too much, is that pressure?

**ANDRE:** Depends on how you bring it up.

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**ANDRE:** No. You're supposed to figure out if this is something you can live with or not.

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**GARRETT:** What if she's fine with how things are? What if she doesn't see it as a problem?

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?

**ANDRE:** Not to this extent. But we've had conversations about it. There've been times when one of us wanted more and the other wasn't feeling it.

**ANDRE:** How did you work through it?

**ANDRE:** We just talked it out. Made sure we were both feeling heard. And we try to meet in the middle. Like, if she's not in the mood for full-on sex, maybe we do something else. Just to maintain that physical connection.

**GARRETT:** Taylor won't even do that. If she's not in the mood, that's it. Everything's off the table.

**ANDRE:** That's tough. Because you're right, you need some kind of physical intimacy. Even if it's not always sex.

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**ANDRE:** And you do respect it. But you're allowed to be frustrated about it.

**GARRETT:** Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to be frustrated. Like I'm supposed to just be understanding all the time.

**ANDRE:** You can be both. You can understand where she's coming from and still have your own feelings about it.

**GARRETT:** I just don't know how to fix this. We're stuck.

**ANDRE:** Maybe you need to have a bigger conversation. Not just about sex, but about the relationship as a whole. See if there are other issues hiding underneath.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** You might be onto something. Things have felt off in general lately. Not just the sex stuff.

**ANDRE:** There you go. Maybe start there. Talk about how you're both feeling about the relationship. See what comes up.

**GARRETT:** And if nothing comes up? If she says everything's fine except for my constant need for sex?

**ANDRE:** Then you're back to the same question. Can you live with this long-term or not?

**GARRETT:** I don't think I can. Not if it stays like this.

**ANDRE:** Then you might need to tell her that. Not as an ultimatum, but as honest communication about where you're at.

**GARRETT:** That's scary though. What if she says she can't change? Or won't change?

**ANDRE:** Then you have your answer. And you can make a decision from there.

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** I know. But you also can't stay in a relationship where you're constantly unsatisfied. That's not fair to either of you.

**GARRETT:** Yeah. You're right. I need to think about this more. Maybe talk to her this weekend when we actually have time.

**ANDRE:** Good idea. And go into it without expectations. Just be honest about how you're feeling.

**GARRETT:** I will. Thanks for talking this through with me. I know it's awkward.

**ANDRE:** It's not awkward. This is what friends do. We talk about the uncomfortable stuff.

**GARRETT:** Still. I appreciate it.

**ANDRE:** Anytime, man. Let me know how it goes.## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**GARRETT:** Can I ask you something kind of personal?

**ANDRE:** Yeah, man. What's up?

**GARRETT:** How often do you and Vanessa have sex?

**ANDRE:** Whoa. That's pretty direct.

**GARRETT:** I know. Sorry. You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out if what's happening with me and Taylor is normal or not.

**ANDRE:** What's happening?

**GARRETT:** We're just... not on the same page. Like, at all. When it comes to sex.

**ANDRE:** How so?

**GARRETT:** I want it way more than she does. And it's starting to become a problem.

**ANDRE:** Define way more.

**GARRETT:** I don't know. I'd be happy with three, four times a week. She's more like once a week. Maybe twice if I'm lucky.

**ANDRE:** And that's not enough for you?

**GARRETT:** Not really. I mean, it's not just about the frequency. It's about feeling wanted. Connected. When we go a week without sex, I start to feel like we're just roommates.

**ANDRE:** Have you told her that?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. Multiple times. She says she's tired. Or stressed. Or not in the mood. And I get it. Life is busy. But it feels like there's always an excuse.

**ANDRE:** Does she ever initiate?

**GARRETT:** Almost never. It's always me. And half the time when I try, she shuts me down.

**ANDRE:** That's gotta be frustrating.

**GARRETT:** It's more than frustrating. It's starting to mess with my head. Like, am I not attractive to her anymore? Is she not into me?

**ANDRE:** What does she say when you ask her that?

**GARRETT:** She says of course she's attracted to me. That it has nothing to do with that. But I don't know, man. Actions speak louder than words.

**ANDRE:** Maybe her sex drive is just lower than yours. That's pretty common.

**GARRETT:** I know it's common. But how do you deal with it? How do you not take it personally?

**ANDRE:** I mean, Vanessa and I aren't exactly rabbits either. We probably average twice a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

**GARRETT:** And that works for both of you?

**ANDRE:** It works well enough. There are times I'd like more, but I'm not gonna pressure her if she's not feeling it.

**GARRETT:** See, that's where I struggle. I don't want to pressure her. But I also don't want to just accept a sexless relationship.

**ANDRE:** Once a week isn't sexless.

**GARRETT:** It feels like it to me. Especially when I think about how things used to be.

**ANDRE:** What do you mean?

**GARRETT:** When we first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We'd have sex multiple times a day sometimes. It was intense.

**ANDRE:** That's the honeymoon phase, dude. It always slows down.

**GARRETT:** I know. But this feels like more than slowing down. This feels like stopping.

**ANDRE:** How long have you guys been together now?

**GARRETT:** Three years. We moved in together about six months ago.

**ANDRE:** And when did the sex drop off?

**GARRETT:** Pretty much right after we moved in. At first I thought it was just the stress of the move. But it's been six months and nothing's changed.

**ANDRE:** Did something happen? Like a specific incident?

**GARRETT:** Not that I know of. We didn't have a fight or anything. It just gradually became less frequent.

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. She says everything's fine. That she's just not as sexual as she used to be. Which makes me feel great, by the way.

**ANDRE:** I'm sure she didn't mean it like that.

**GARRETT:** Maybe not. But that's how it landed. Like, our relationship made her less interested in sex. How is that not a red flag?

**ANDRE:** Could be hormonal. Could be stress. Could be a million things that have nothing to do with you.

**GARRETT:** Then why won't she do something about it? I suggested she talk to her doctor. She blew me off.

**ANDRE:** She probably doesn't see it as a medical issue.

**GARRETT:** But what if it is? What if her hormones are off or something? Wouldn't she want to know?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** Am I? Am I making too big a deal out of this?

**ANDRE:** I don't know, man. Sex is important in a relationship. But so is respecting your partner's boundaries.

**GARRETT:** I'm not crossing any boundaries. I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just expressing that I have needs too.

**ANDRE:** And what does she say when you express that?

**GARRETT:** She gets defensive. Says I'm making her feel bad about herself. That I'm pressuring her.

**ANDRE:** Are you pressuring her?

**GARRETT:** I don't think so. But maybe I am without realizing it. Like, if I bring it up too much, is that pressure?

**ANDRE:** Depends on how you bring it up.

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** Because to her, it probably feels like you're saying she's not doing enough.

**GARRETT:** But she's not. That's the problem. I'm not getting what I need from this relationship.

**ANDRE:** Okay, but have you asked her what she needs?

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** Like, maybe there's a reason she's not in the mood. Maybe there's something you could be doing differently that would help.

**GARRETT:** I've asked. She says she doesn't know. That she's just not feeling it.

**ANDRE:** That's frustrating.

**GARRETT:** Tell me about it. I'm trying to problem-solve here, and she won't even engage with the conversation.

**ANDRE:** Maybe she feels attacked. Like you're saying there's something wrong with her.

**GARRETT:** I'm not saying there's something wrong with her. I'm saying we have incompatible sex drives. That's not an attack, it's just a fact.

**ANDRE:** But the way you frame it matters. If you're coming at it like it's her fault, she's gonna shut down.

**GARRETT:** How else am I supposed to frame it? She's the one who's not interested.

**ANDRE:** See, that right there. You're making it about her not being interested. What if it's about you not creating the right environment for her to be interested?

**GARRETT:** What does that even mean?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. I'm not in your relationship. But maybe there's emotional stuff that needs to happen before physical stuff. For some people, that's how it works.

**GARRETT:** You think I'm not being emotionally available?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** Not in those exact words. But I've asked if she needs more romance or whatever. She said no.

**ANDRE:** What about stress? You said she's stressed. Is work bad right now?

**GARRETT:** Yeah, actually. She's been working late a lot. Her boss is kind of a nightmare.

**ANDRE:** So she comes home exhausted and you want to have sex. I can see how that might not line up.

**GARRETT:** I'm not jumping her the second she walks in the door. I give her space. But eventually, we need to connect. We can't just be two tired people living in the same apartment.

**ANDRE:** True. But if she's running on empty, sex might just feel like another obligation.

**GARRETT:** So what am I supposed to do? Just wait until her job gets better? That could be months. Years.

**ANDRE:** No, but you might need to adjust your expectations. And find other ways to feel connected that aren't sex.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Spending quality time together. Going on dates. Doing things she enjoys.

**GARRETT:** We do that stuff. We go out to dinner. We watch shows together. But it doesn't lead to anything physical.

**ANDRE:** Maybe it's not supposed to lead to anything. Maybe it's just about being together.

**GARRETT:** I hear you, but I need physical intimacy. That's a legitimate need.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** I know. But you also can't stay in a relationship where you're constantly unsatisfied. That's not fair to either of you.

**GARRETT:** Yeah. You're right. I need to think about this more. Maybe talk to her this weekend when we actually have time.

**ANDRE:** Good idea. And go into it without expectations. Just be honest about how you're feeling.

**GARRETT:** I will. Thanks for talking this through with me. I know it's awkward.

**ANDRE:** It's not awkward. This is what friends do. We talk about the uncomfortable stuff.

**GARRETT:** Still. I appreciate it.

**ANDRE:** Anytime, man. Let me know how it goes.## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**GARRETT:** Can I ask you something kind of personal?

**ANDRE:** Yeah, man. What's up?

**GARRETT:** How often do you and Vanessa have sex?

**ANDRE:** Whoa. That's pretty direct.

**GARRETT:** I know. Sorry. You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out if what's happening with me and Taylor is normal or not.

**ANDRE:** What's happening?

**GARRETT:** We're just... not on the same page. Like, at all. When it comes to sex.

**ANDRE:** How so?

**GARRETT:** I want it way more than she does. And it's starting to become a problem.

**ANDRE:** Define way more.

**GARRETT:** I don't know. I'd be happy with three, four times a week. She's more like once a week. Maybe twice if I'm lucky.

**ANDRE:** And that's not enough for you?

**GARRETT:** Not really. I mean, it's not just about the frequency. It's about feeling wanted. Connected. When we go a week without sex, I start to feel like we're just roommates.

**ANDRE:** Have you told her that?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. Multiple times. She says she's tired. Or stressed. Or not in the mood. And I get it. Life is busy. But it feels like there's always an excuse.

**ANDRE:** Does she ever initiate?

**GARRETT:** Almost never. It's always me. And half the time when I try, she shuts me down.

**ANDRE:** That's gotta be frustrating.

**GARRETT:** It's more than frustrating. It's starting to mess with my head. Like, am I not attractive to her anymore? Is she not into me?

**ANDRE:** What does she say when you ask her that?

**GARRETT:** She says of course she's attracted to me. That it has nothing to do with that. But I don't know, man. Actions speak louder than words.

**ANDRE:** Maybe her sex drive is just lower than yours. That's pretty common.

**GARRETT:** I know it's common. But how do you deal with it? How do you not take it personally?

**ANDRE:** I mean, Vanessa and I aren't exactly rabbits either. We probably average twice a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

**GARRETT:** And that works for both of you?

**ANDRE:** It works well enough. There are times I'd like more, but I'm not gonna pressure her if she's not feeling it.

**GARRETT:** See, that's where I struggle. I don't want to pressure her. But I also don't want to just accept a sexless relationship.

**ANDRE:** Once a week isn't sexless.

**GARRETT:** It feels like it to me. Especially when I think about how things used to be.

**ANDRE:** What do you mean?

**GARRETT:** When we first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We'd have sex multiple times a day sometimes. It was intense.

**ANDRE:** That's the honeymoon phase, dude. It always slows down.

**GARRETT:** I know. But this feels like more than slowing down. This feels like stopping.

**ANDRE:** How long have you guys been together now?

**GARRETT:** Three years. We moved in together about six months ago.

**ANDRE:** And when did the sex drop off?

**GARRETT:** Pretty much right after we moved in. At first I thought it was just the stress of the move. But it's been six months and nothing's changed.

**ANDRE:** Did something happen? Like a specific incident?

**GARRETT:** Not that I know of. We didn't have a fight or anything. It just gradually became less frequent.

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. She says everything's fine. That she's just not as sexual as she used to be. Which makes me feel great, by the way.

**ANDRE:** I'm sure she didn't mean it like that.

**GARRETT:** Maybe not. But that's how it landed. Like, our relationship made her less interested in sex. How is that not a red flag?

**ANDRE:** Could be hormonal. Could be stress. Could be a million things that have nothing to do with you.

**GARRETT:** Then why won't she do something about it? I suggested she talk to her doctor. She blew me off.

**ANDRE:** She probably doesn't see it as a medical issue.

**GARRETT:** But what if it is? What if her hormones are off or something? Wouldn't she want to know?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** Am I? Am I making too big a deal out of this?

**ANDRE:** I don't know, man. Sex is important in a relationship. But so is respecting your partner's boundaries.

**GARRETT:** I'm not crossing any boundaries. I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just expressing that I have needs too.

**ANDRE:** And what does she say when you express that?

**GARRETT:** She gets defensive. Says I'm making her feel bad about herself. That I'm pressuring her.

**ANDRE:** Are you pressuring her?

**GARRETT:** I don't think so. But maybe I am without realizing it. Like, if I bring it up too much, is that pressure?

**ANDRE:** Depends on how you bring it up.

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** Because to her, it probably feels like you're saying she's not doing enough.

**GARRETT:** But she's not. That's the problem. I'm not getting what I need from this relationship.

**ANDRE:** Okay, but have you asked her what she needs?

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** Like, maybe there's a reason she's not in the mood. Maybe there's something you could be doing differently that would help.

**GARRETT:** I've asked. She says she doesn't know. That she's just not feeling it.

**ANDRE:** That's frustrating.

**GARRETT:** Tell me about it. I'm trying to problem-solve here, and she won't even engage with the conversation.

**ANDRE:** Maybe she feels attacked. Like you're saying there's something wrong with her.

**GARRETT:** I'm not saying there's something wrong with her. I'm saying we have incompatible sex drives. That's not an attack, it's just a fact.

**ANDRE:** But the way you frame it matters. If you're coming at it like it's her fault, she's gonna shut down.

**GARRETT:** How else am I supposed to frame it? She's the one who's not interested.

**ANDRE:** See, that right there. You're making it about her not being interested. What if it's about you not creating the right environment for her to be interested?

**GARRETT:** What does that even mean?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. I'm not in your relationship. But maybe there's emotional stuff that needs to happen before physical stuff. For some people, that's how it works.

**GARRETT:** You think I'm not being emotionally available?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** Not in those exact words. But I've asked if she needs more romance or whatever. She said no.

**ANDRE:** What about stress? You said she's stressed. Is work bad right now?

**GARRETT:** Yeah, actually. She's been working late a lot. Her boss is kind of a nightmare.

**ANDRE:** So she comes home exhausted and you want to have sex. I can see how that might not line up.

**GARRETT:** I'm not jumping her the second she walks in the door. I give her space. But eventually, we need to connect. We can't just be two tired people living in the same apartment.

**ANDRE:** True. But if she's running on empty, sex might just feel like another obligation.

**GARRETT:** So what am I supposed to do? Just wait until her job gets better? That could be months. Years.

**ANDRE:** No, but you might need to adjust your expectations. And find other ways to feel connected that aren't sex.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Spending quality time together. Going on dates. Doing things she enjoys.

**GARRETT:** We do that stuff. We go out to dinner. We watch shows together. But it doesn't lead to anything physical.

**ANDRE:** Maybe it's not supposed to lead to anything. Maybe it's just about being together.

**GARRETT:** I hear you, but I need physical intimacy. That's a legitimate need.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**ANDRE:** No. You're supposed to figure out if this is something you can live with or not.

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**GARRETT:** What if she's fine with how things are? What if she doesn't see it as a problem?

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?

**ANDRE:** Not to this extent. But we've had conversations about it. There've been times when one of us wanted more and the other wasn't feeling it.

**ANDRE:** How did you work through it?

**ANDRE:** We just talked it out. Made sure we were both feeling heard. And we try to meet in the middle. Like, if she's not in the mood for full-on sex, maybe we do something else. Just to maintain that physical connection.

**GARRETT:** Taylor won't even do that. If she's not in the mood, that's it. Everything's off the table.

**ANDRE:** That's tough. Because you're right, you need some kind of physical intimacy. Even if it's not always sex.

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**ANDRE:** And you do respect it. But you're allowed to be frustrated about it.

**GARRETT:** Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to be frustrated. Like I'm supposed to just be understanding all the time.

**ANDRE:** You can be both. You can understand where she's coming from and still have your own feelings about it.

**GARRETT:** I just don't know how to fix this. We're stuck.

**ANDRE:** Maybe you need to have a bigger conversation. Not just about sex, but about the relationship as a whole. See if there are other issues hiding underneath.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** You might be onto something. Things have felt off in general lately. Not just the sex stuff.

**ANDRE:** There you go. Maybe start there. Talk about how you're both feeling about the relationship. See what comes up.

**GARRETT:** And if nothing comes up? If she says everything's fine except for my constant need for sex?

**ANDRE:** Then you're back to the same question. Can you live with this long-term or not?

**GARRETT:** I don't think I can. Not if it stays like this.

**ANDRE:** Then you might need to tell her that. Not as an ultimatum, but as honest communication about where you're at.

**GARRETT:** That's scary though. What if she says she can't change? Or won't change?

**ANDRE:** Then you have your answer. And you can make a decision from there.

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** What do you mean?

**GARRETT:** When we first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We'd have sex multiple times a day sometimes. It was intense.

**ANDRE:** That's the honeymoon phase, dude. It always slows down.

**GARRETT:** I know. But this feels like more than slowing down. This feels like stopping.

**ANDRE:** How long have you guys been together now?

**GARRETT:** Three years. We moved in together about six months ago.

**ANDRE:** And when did the sex drop off?

**GARRETT:** Pretty much right after we moved in. At first I thought it was just the stress of the move. But it's been six months and nothing's changed.

**ANDRE:** Did something happen? Like a specific incident?

**GARRETT:** Not that I know of. We didn't have a fight or anything. It just gradually became less frequent.

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. She says everything's fine. That she's just not as sexual as she used to be. Which makes me feel great, by the way.

**ANDRE:** I'm sure she didn't mean it like that.

**GARRETT:** Maybe not. But that's how it landed. Like, our relationship made her less interested in sex. How is that not a red flag?

**ANDRE:** Could be hormonal. Could be stress. Could be a million things that have nothing to do with you.

**GARRETT:** Then why won't she do something about it? I suggested she talk to her doctor. She blew me off.

**ANDRE:** She probably doesn't see it as a medical issue.

**GARRETT:** But what if it is? What if her hormones are off or something? Wouldn't she want to know?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** Am I? Am I making too big a deal out of this?

**ANDRE:** I don't know, man. Sex is important in a relationship. But so is respecting your partner's boundaries.

**GARRETT:** I'm not crossing any boundaries. I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just expressing that I have needs too.

**ANDRE:** And what does she say when you express that?

**GARRETT:** She gets defensive. Says I'm making her feel bad about herself. That I'm pressuring her.

**ANDRE:** Are you pressuring her?

**GARRETT:** I don't think so. But maybe I am without realizing it. Like, if I bring it up too much, is that pressure?

**ANDRE:** Depends on how you bring it up.

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** Because to her, it probably feels like you're saying she's not doing enough.

**GARRETT:** But she's not. That's the problem. I'm not getting what I need from this relationship.

**ANDRE:** Okay, but have you asked her what she needs?

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** Like, maybe there's a reason she's not in the mood. Maybe there's something you could be doing differently that would help.

**GARRETT:** I've asked. She says she doesn't know. That she's just not feeling it.

**ANDRE:** That's frustrating.

**GARRETT:** Tell me about it. I'm trying to problem-solve here, and she won't even engage with the conversation.

**ANDRE:** Maybe she feels attacked. Like you're saying there's something wrong with her.

**GARRETT:** I'm not saying there's something wrong with her. I'm saying we have incompatible sex drives. That's not an attack, it's just a fact.

**ANDRE:** But the way you frame it matters. If you're coming at it like it's her fault, she's gonna shut down.

**GARRETT:** How else am I supposed to frame it? She's the one who's not interested.

**ANDRE:** See, that right there. You're making it about her not being interested. What if it's about you not creating the right environment for her to be interested?

**GARRETT:** What does that even mean?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. I'm not in your relationship. But maybe there's emotional stuff that needs to happen before physical stuff. For some people, that's how it works.

**GARRETT:** You think I'm not being emotionally available?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** Not in those exact words. But I've asked if she needs more romance or whatever. She said no.

**ANDRE:** What about stress? You said she's stressed. Is work bad right now?

**GARRETT:** Yeah, actually. She's been working late a lot. Her boss is kind of a nightmare.

**ANDRE:** So she comes home exhausted and you want to have sex. I can see how that might not line up.

**GARRETT:** I'm not jumping her the second she walks in the door. I give her space. But eventually, we need to connect. We can't just be two tired people living in the same apartment.

**ANDRE:** True. But if she's running on empty, sex might just feel like another obligation.

**GARRETT:** So what am I supposed to do? Just wait until her job gets better? That could be months. Years.

**ANDRE:** No, but you might need to adjust your expectations. And find other ways to feel connected that aren't sex.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Spending quality time together. Going on dates. Doing things she enjoys.

**GARRETT:** We do that stuff. We go out to dinner. We watch shows together. But it doesn't lead to anything physical.

**ANDRE:** Maybe it's not supposed to lead to anything. Maybe it's just about being together.

**GARRETT:** I hear you, but I need physical intimacy. That's a legitimate need.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**ANDRE:** No. You're supposed to figure out if this is something you can live with or not.

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**GARRETT:** What if she's fine with how things are? What if she doesn't see it as a problem?

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?

**ANDRE:** Not to this extent. But we've had conversations about it. There've been times when one of us wanted more and the other wasn't feeling it.

**ANDRE:** How did you work through it?

**ANDRE:** We just talked it out. Made sure we were both feeling heard. And we try to meet in the middle. Like, if she's not in the mood for full-on sex, maybe we do something else. Just to maintain that physical connection.

**GARRETT:** Taylor won't even do that. If she's not in the mood, that's it. Everything's off the table.

**ANDRE:** That's tough. Because you're right, you need some kind of physical intimacy. Even if it's not always sex.

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**ANDRE:** And you do respect it. But you're allowed to be frustrated about it.

**GARRETT:** Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to be frustrated. Like I'm supposed to just be understanding all the time.

**ANDRE:** You can be both. You can understand where she's coming from and still have your own feelings about it.

**GARRETT:** I just don't know how to fix this. We're stuck.

**ANDRE:** Maybe you need to have a bigger conversation. Not just about sex, but about the relationship as a whole. See if there are other issues hiding underneath.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** You might be onto something. Things have felt off in general lately. Not just the sex stuff.

**ANDRE:** There you go. Maybe start there. Talk about how you're both feeling about the relationship. See what comes up.

**GARRETT:** And if nothing comes up? If she says everything's fine except for my constant need for sex?

**ANDRE:** Then you're back to the same question. Can you live with this long-term or not?

**GARRETT:** I don't think I can. Not if it stays like this.

**ANDRE:** Then you might need to tell her that. Not as an ultimatum, but as honest communication about where you're at.

**GARRETT:** That's scary though. What if she says she can't change? Or won't change?

**ANDRE:** Then you have your answer. And you can make a decision from there.

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** I know. But you also can't stay in a relationship where you're constantly unsatisfied. That's not fair to either of you.

**GARRETT:** Yeah. You're right. I need to think about this more. Maybe talk to her this weekend when we actually have time.

**ANDRE:** Good idea. And go into it without expectations. Just be honest about how you're feeling.

**GARRETT:** I will. Thanks for talking this through with me. I know it's awkward.

**ANDRE:** It's not awkward. This is what friends do. We talk about the uncomfortable stuff.

**GARRETT:** Still. I appreciate it.

**ANDRE:** Anytime, man. Let me know how it goes.## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**GARRETT:** Can I ask you something kind of personal?

**ANDRE:** Yeah, man. What's up?

**GARRETT:** How often do you and Vanessa have sex?

**ANDRE:** Whoa. That's pretty direct.

**GARRETT:** I know. Sorry. You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out if what's happening with me and Taylor is normal or not.

**ANDRE:** What's happening?

**GARRETT:** We're just... not on the same page. Like, at all. When it comes to sex.

**ANDRE:** How so?

**GARRETT:** I want it way more than she does. And it's starting to become a problem.

**ANDRE:** Define way more.

**GARRETT:** I don't know. I'd be happy with three, four times a week. She's more like once a week. Maybe twice if I'm lucky.

**ANDRE:** And that's not enough for you?

**GARRETT:** Not really. I mean, it's not just about the frequency. It's about feeling wanted. Connected. When we go a week without sex, I start to feel like we're just roommates.

**ANDRE:** Have you told her that?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. Multiple times. She says she's tired. Or stressed. Or not in the mood. And I get it. Life is busy. But it feels like there's always an excuse.

**ANDRE:** Does she ever initiate?

**GARRETT:** Almost never. It's always me. And half the time when I try, she shuts me down.

**ANDRE:** That's gotta be frustrating.

**GARRETT:** It's more than frustrating. It's starting to mess with my head. Like, am I not attractive to her anymore? Is she not into me?

**ANDRE:** What does she say when you ask her that?

**GARRETT:** She says of course she's attracted to me. That it has nothing to do with that. But I don't know, man. Actions speak louder than words.

**ANDRE:** Maybe her sex drive is just lower than yours. That's pretty common.

**GARRETT:** I know it's common. But how do you deal with it? How do you not take it personally?

**ANDRE:** I mean, Vanessa and I aren't exactly rabbits either. We probably average twice a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

**GARRETT:** And that works for both of you?

**ANDRE:** It works well enough. There are times I'd like more, but I'm not gonna pressure her if she's not feeling it.

**GARRETT:** See, that's where I struggle. I don't want to pressure her. But I also don't want to just accept a sexless relationship.

**ANDRE:** Once a week isn't sexless.

**GARRETT:** It feels like it to me. Especially when I think about how things used to be.

**GARRETT:** I'm not saying there's something wrong with her. I'm saying we have incompatible sex drives. That's not an attack, it's just a fact.

**ANDRE:** But the way you frame it matters. If you're coming at it like it's her fault, she's gonna shut down.

**GARRETT:** How else am I supposed to frame it? She's the one who's not interested.

**ANDRE:** See, that right there. You're making it about her not being interested. What if it's about you not creating the right environment for her to be interested?

**GARRETT:** What does that even mean?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. I'm not in your relationship. But maybe there's emotional stuff that needs to happen before physical stuff. For some people, that's how it works.

**GARRETT:** You think I'm not being emotionally available?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** Not in those exact words. But I've asked if she needs more romance or whatever. She said no.

**ANDRE:** What about stress? You said she's stressed. Is work bad right now?

**GARRETT:** Yeah, actually. She's been working late a lot. Her boss is kind of a nightmare.

**ANDRE:** So she comes home exhausted and you want to have sex. I can see how that might not line up.

**GARRETT:** I'm not jumping her the second she walks in the door. I give her space. But eventually, we need to connect. We can't just be two tired people living in the same apartment.

**ANDRE:** True. But if she's running on empty, sex might just feel like another obligation.

**GARRETT:** So what am I supposed to do? Just wait until her job gets better? That could be months. Years.

**ANDRE:** No, but you might need to adjust your expectations. And find other ways to feel connected that aren't sex.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Spending quality time together. Going on dates. Doing things she enjoys.

**GARRETT:** We do that stuff. We go out to dinner. We watch shows together. But it doesn't lead to anything physical.

**ANDRE:** Maybe it's not supposed to lead to anything. Maybe it's just about being together.

**GARRETT:** I hear you, but I need physical intimacy. That's a legitimate need.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**ANDRE:** No. You're supposed to figure out if this is something you can live with or not.

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**GARRETT:** What if she's fine with how things are? What if she doesn't see it as a problem?

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?

**ANDRE:** Not to this extent. But we've had conversations about it. There've been times when one of us wanted more and the other wasn't feeling it.

**ANDRE:** How did you work through it?

**ANDRE:** We just talked it out. Made sure we were both feeling heard. And we try to meet in the middle. Like, if she's not in the mood for full-on sex, maybe we do something else. Just to maintain that physical connection.

**GARRETT:** Taylor won't even do that. If she's not in the mood, that's it. Everything's off the table.

**ANDRE:** That's tough. Because you're right, you need some kind of physical intimacy. Even if it's not always sex.

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**ANDRE:** And you do respect it. But you're allowed to be frustrated about it.

**GARRETT:** Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to be frustrated. Like I'm supposed to just be understanding all the time.

**ANDRE:** You can be both. You can understand where she's coming from and still have your own feelings about it.

**GARRETT:** I just don't know how to fix this. We're stuck.

**ANDRE:** Maybe you need to have a bigger conversation. Not just about sex, but about the relationship as a whole. See if there are other issues hiding underneath.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** You might be onto something. Things have felt off in general lately. Not just the sex stuff.

**ANDRE:** There you go. Maybe start there. Talk about how you're both feeling about the relationship. See what comes up.

**GARRETT:** And if nothing comes up? If she says everything's fine except for my constant need for sex?

**ANDRE:** Then you're back to the same question. Can you live with this long-term or not?

**GARRETT:** I don't think I can. Not if it stays like this.

**ANDRE:** Then you might need to tell her that. Not as an ultimatum, but as honest communication about where you're at.

**GARRETT:** That's scary though. What if she says she can't change? Or won't change?

**ANDRE:** Then you have your answer. And you can make a decision from there.

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** I know. But you also can't stay in a relationship where you're constantly unsatisfied. That's not fair to either of you.

**GARRETT:** Yeah. You're right. I need to think about this more. Maybe talk to her this weekend when we actually have time.

**ANDRE:** Good idea. And go into it without expectations. Just be honest about how you're feeling.

**GARRETT:** I will. Thanks for talking this through with me. I know it's awkward.

**ANDRE:** It's not awkward. This is what friends do. We talk about the uncomfortable stuff.

**GARRETT:** Still. I appreciate it.

**ANDRE:** Anytime, man. Let me know how it goes.## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**GARRETT:** Can I ask you something kind of personal?

**ANDRE:** Yeah, man. What's up?

**GARRETT:** How often do you and Vanessa have sex?

**ANDRE:** Whoa. That's pretty direct.

**GARRETT:** I know. Sorry. You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out if what's happening with me and Taylor is normal or not.

**ANDRE:** What's happening?

**GARRETT:** We're just... not on the same page. Like, at all. When it comes to sex.

**ANDRE:** How so?

**GARRETT:** I want it way more than she does. And it's starting to become a problem.

**ANDRE:** Define way more.

**GARRETT:** I don't know. I'd be happy with three, four times a week. She's more like once a week. Maybe twice if I'm lucky.

**ANDRE:** And that's not enough for you?

**GARRETT:** Not really. I mean, it's not just about the frequency. It's about feeling wanted. Connected. When we go a week without sex, I start to feel like we're just roommates.

**ANDRE:** Have you told her that?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. Multiple times. She says she's tired. Or stressed. Or not in the mood. And I get it. Life is busy. But it feels like there's always an excuse.

**ANDRE:** Does she ever initiate?

**GARRETT:** Almost never. It's always me. And half the time when I try, she shuts me down.

**ANDRE:** That's gotta be frustrating.

**GARRETT:** It's more than frustrating. It's starting to mess with my head. Like, am I not attractive to her anymore? Is she not into me?

**ANDRE:** What does she say when you ask her that?

**GARRETT:** She says of course she's attracted to me. That it has nothing to do with that. But I don't know, man. Actions speak louder than words.

**ANDRE:** Maybe her sex drive is just lower than yours. That's pretty common.

**GARRETT:** I know it's common. But how do you deal with it? How do you not take it personally?

**ANDRE:** I mean, Vanessa and I aren't exactly rabbits either. We probably average twice a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

**GARRETT:** And that works for both of you?

**ANDRE:** It works well enough. There are times I'd like more, but I'm not gonna pressure her if she's not feeling it.

**GARRETT:** See, that's where I struggle. I don't want to pressure her. But I also don't want to just accept a sexless relationship.

**ANDRE:** Once a week isn't sexless.

**GARRETT:** It feels like it to me. Especially when I think about how things used to be.

**ANDRE:** What do you mean?

**GARRETT:** When we first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We'd have sex multiple times a day sometimes. It was intense.

**ANDRE:** That's the honeymoon phase, dude. It always slows down.

**GARRETT:** I know. But this feels like more than slowing down. This feels like stopping.

**ANDRE:** How long have you guys been together now?

**GARRETT:** Three years. We moved in together about six months ago.

**ANDRE:** And when did the sex drop off?

**GARRETT:** Pretty much right after we moved in. At first I thought it was just the stress of the move. But it's been six months and nothing's changed.

**ANDRE:** Did something happen? Like a specific incident?

**GARRETT:** Not that I know of. We didn't have a fight or anything. It just gradually became less frequent.

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. She says everything's fine. That she's just not as sexual as she used to be. Which makes me feel great, by the way.

**ANDRE:** I'm sure she didn't mean it like that.

**GARRETT:** Maybe not. But that's how it landed. Like, our relationship made her less interested in sex. How is that not a red flag?

**ANDRE:** Could be hormonal. Could be stress. Could be a million things that have nothing to do with you.

**GARRETT:** Then why won't she do something about it? I suggested she talk to her doctor. She blew me off.

**ANDRE:** She probably doesn't see it as a medical issue.

**GARRETT:** But what if it is? What if her hormones are off or something? Wouldn't she want to know?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** Am I? Am I making too big a deal out of this?

**ANDRE:** I don't know, man. Sex is important in a relationship. But so is respecting your partner's boundaries.

**GARRETT:** I'm not crossing any boundaries. I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just expressing that I have needs too.

**ANDRE:** And what does she say when you express that?

**GARRETT:** She gets defensive. Says I'm making her feel bad about herself. That I'm pressuring her.

**ANDRE:** Are you pressuring her?

**GARRETT:** I don't think so. But maybe I am without realizing it. Like, if I bring it up too much, is that pressure?

**ANDRE:** Depends on how you bring it up.

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** Because to her, it probably feels like you're saying she's not doing enough.

**GARRETT:** But she's not. That's the problem. I'm not getting what I need from this relationship.

**ANDRE:** Okay, but have you asked her what she needs?

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** Like, maybe there's a reason she's not in the mood. Maybe there's something you could be doing differently that would help.

**GARRETT:** I've asked. She says she doesn't know. That she's just not feeling it.

**ANDRE:** That's frustrating.

**GARRETT:** Tell me about it. I'm trying to problem-solve here, and she won't even engage with the conversation.

**ANDRE:** Maybe she feels attacked. Like you're saying there's something wrong with her.

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?

**ANDRE:** Not to this extent. But we've had conversations about it. There've been times when one of us wanted more and the other wasn't feeling it.

**ANDRE:** How did you work through it?

**ANDRE:** We just talked it out. Made sure we were both feeling heard. And we try to meet in the middle. Like, if she's not in the mood for full-on sex, maybe we do something else. Just to maintain that physical connection.

**GARRETT:** Taylor won't even do that. If she's not in the mood, that's it. Everything's off the table.

**ANDRE:** That's tough. Because you're right, you need some kind of physical intimacy. Even if it's not always sex.

**GARRETT:** Exactly. But she doesn't see it that way. To her, if she's not feeling it, I should just respect that and leave her alone.

**ANDRE:** And you do respect it. But you're allowed to be frustrated about it.

**GARRETT:** Thank you. Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to be frustrated. Like I'm supposed to just be understanding all the time.

**ANDRE:** You can be both. You can understand where she's coming from and still have your own feelings about it.

**GARRETT:** I just don't know how to fix this. We're stuck.

**ANDRE:** Maybe you need to have a bigger conversation. Not just about sex, but about the relationship as a whole. See if there are other issues hiding underneath.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Resentment about something. Feeling disconnected in other ways. Sometimes sex is the symptom, not the actual problem.

**GARRETT:** You might be onto something. Things have felt off in general lately. Not just the sex stuff.

**ANDRE:** There you go. Maybe start there. Talk about how you're both feeling about the relationship. See what comes up.

**GARRETT:** And if nothing comes up? If she says everything's fine except for my constant need for sex?

**ANDRE:** Then you're back to the same question. Can you live with this long-term or not?

**GARRETT:** I don't think I can. Not if it stays like this.

**ANDRE:** Then you might need to tell her that. Not as an ultimatum, but as honest communication about where you're at.

**GARRETT:** That's scary though. What if she says she can't change? Or won't change?

**ANDRE:** Then you have your answer. And you can make a decision from there.

**GARRETT:** I don't want to lose her.

**ANDRE:** I know. But you also can't stay in a relationship where you're constantly unsatisfied. That's not fair to either of you.

**GARRETT:** Yeah. You're right. I need to think about this more. Maybe talk to her this weekend when we actually have time.

**ANDRE:** Good idea. And go into it without expectations. Just be honest about how you're feeling.

**GARRETT:** I will. Thanks for talking this through with me. I know it's awkward.

**ANDRE:** It's not awkward. This is what friends do. We talk about the uncomfortable stuff.

**GARRETT:** Still. I appreciate it.

**ANDRE:** Anytime, man. Let me know how it goes.## Subtopic 6: Navigating different sex drives and physical intimacy needs

**GARRETT:** Can I ask you something kind of personal?

**ANDRE:** Yeah, man. What's up?

**GARRETT:** How often do you and Vanessa have sex?

**ANDRE:** Whoa. That's pretty direct.

**GARRETT:** I know. Sorry. You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out if what's happening with me and Taylor is normal or not.

**ANDRE:** What's happening?

**GARRETT:** We're just... not on the same page. Like, at all. When it comes to sex.

**ANDRE:** How so?

**GARRETT:** I want it way more than she does. And it's starting to become a problem.

**ANDRE:** Define way more.

**GARRETT:** I don't know. I'd be happy with three, four times a week. She's more like once a week. Maybe twice if I'm lucky.

**ANDRE:** And that's not enough for you?

**GARRETT:** Not really. I mean, it's not just about the frequency. It's about feeling wanted. Connected. When we go a week without sex, I start to feel like we're just roommates.

**ANDRE:** Have you told her that?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. Multiple times. She says she's tired. Or stressed. Or not in the mood. And I get it. Life is busy. But it feels like there's always an excuse.

**ANDRE:** Does she ever initiate?

**GARRETT:** Almost never. It's always me. And half the time when I try, she shuts me down.

**ANDRE:** That's gotta be frustrating.

**GARRETT:** It's more than frustrating. It's starting to mess with my head. Like, am I not attractive to her anymore? Is she not into me?

**ANDRE:** What does she say when you ask her that?

**GARRETT:** She says of course she's attracted to me. That it has nothing to do with that. But I don't know, man. Actions speak louder than words.

**ANDRE:** Maybe her sex drive is just lower than yours. That's pretty common.

**GARRETT:** I know it's common. But how do you deal with it? How do you not take it personally?

**ANDRE:** I mean, Vanessa and I aren't exactly rabbits either. We probably average twice a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

**GARRETT:** And that works for both of you?

**ANDRE:** It works well enough. There are times I'd like more, but I'm not gonna pressure her if she's not feeling it.

**GARRETT:** See, that's where I struggle. I don't want to pressure her. But I also don't want to just accept a sexless relationship.

**ANDRE:** Once a week isn't sexless.

**GARRETT:** It feels like it to me. Especially when I think about how things used to be.

**ANDRE:** What do you mean?

**GARRETT:** When we first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We'd have sex multiple times a day sometimes. It was intense.

**ANDRE:** That's the honeymoon phase, dude. It always slows down.

**GARRETT:** I know. But this feels like more than slowing down. This feels like stopping.

**ANDRE:** How long have you guys been together now?

**GARRETT:** Three years. We moved in together about six months ago.

**ANDRE:** And when did the sex drop off?

**GARRETT:** Pretty much right after we moved in. At first I thought it was just the stress of the move. But it's been six months and nothing's changed.

**ANDRE:** Did something happen? Like a specific incident?

**GARRETT:** Not that I know of. We didn't have a fight or anything. It just gradually became less frequent.

**ANDRE:** Have you asked her if something's wrong?

**GARRETT:** Yeah. She says everything's fine. That she's just not as sexual as she used to be. Which makes me feel great, by the way.

**ANDRE:** I'm sure she didn't mean it like that.

**GARRETT:** Maybe not. But that's how it landed. Like, our relationship made her less interested in sex. How is that not a red flag?

**ANDRE:** Could be hormonal. Could be stress. Could be a million things that have nothing to do with you.

**GARRETT:** Then why won't she do something about it? I suggested she talk to her doctor. She blew me off.

**ANDRE:** She probably doesn't see it as a medical issue.

**GARRETT:** But what if it is? What if her hormones are off or something? Wouldn't she want to know?

**ANDRE:** Maybe she's embarrassed. Or maybe she thinks you're making too big a deal out of it.

**GARRETT:** Am I? Am I making too big a deal out of this?

**ANDRE:** I don't know, man. Sex is important in a relationship. But so is respecting your partner's boundaries.

**GARRETT:** I'm not crossing any boundaries. I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just expressing that I have needs too.

**ANDRE:** And what does she say when you express that?

**GARRETT:** She gets defensive. Says I'm making her feel bad about herself. That I'm pressuring her.

**ANDRE:** Are you pressuring her?

**GARRETT:** I don't think so. But maybe I am without realizing it. Like, if I bring it up too much, is that pressure?

**ANDRE:** Depends on how you bring it up.

**GARRETT:** I try to be gentle about it. I'll say something like, I miss being close to you. Or, can we make time for each other this week? But she still takes it as criticism.

**ANDRE:** Because to her, it probably feels like you're saying she's not doing enough.

**GARRETT:** But she's not. That's the problem. I'm not getting what I need from this relationship.

**ANDRE:** Okay, but have you asked her what she needs?

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** Like, maybe there's a reason she's not in the mood. Maybe there's something you could be doing differently that would help.

**GARRETT:** I've asked. She says she doesn't know. That she's just not feeling it.

**ANDRE:** That's frustrating.

**GARRETT:** Tell me about it. I'm trying to problem-solve here, and she won't even engage with the conversation.

**ANDRE:** Maybe she feels attacked. Like you're saying there's something wrong with her.

**GARRETT:** I'm not saying there's something wrong with her. I'm saying we have incompatible sex drives. That's not an attack, it's just a fact.

**ANDRE:** But the way you frame it matters. If you're coming at it like it's her fault, she's gonna shut down.

**GARRETT:** How else am I supposed to frame it? She's the one who's not interested.

**ANDRE:** See, that right there. You're making it about her not being interested. What if it's about you not creating the right environment for her to be interested?

**GARRETT:** What does that even mean?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. I'm not in your relationship. But maybe there's emotional stuff that needs to happen before physical stuff. For some people, that's how it works.

**GARRETT:** You think I'm not being emotionally available?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm just throwing out possibilities. Have you asked her if there's anything you could do to help her feel more connected?

**GARRETT:** Not in those exact words. But I've asked if she needs more romance or whatever. She said no.

**ANDRE:** What about stress? You said she's stressed. Is work bad right now?

**GARRETT:** Yeah, actually. She's been working late a lot. Her boss is kind of a nightmare.

**ANDRE:** So she comes home exhausted and you want to have sex. I can see how that might not line up.

**GARRETT:** I'm not jumping her the second she walks in the door. I give her space. But eventually, we need to connect. We can't just be two tired people living in the same apartment.

**ANDRE:** True. But if she's running on empty, sex might just feel like another obligation.

**GARRETT:** So what am I supposed to do? Just wait until her job gets better? That could be months. Years.

**ANDRE:** No, but you might need to adjust your expectations. And find other ways to feel connected that aren't sex.

**GARRETT:** Like what?

**ANDRE:** I don't know. Spending quality time together. Going on dates. Doing things she enjoys.

**GARRETT:** We do that stuff. We go out to dinner. We watch shows together. But it doesn't lead to anything physical.

**ANDRE:** Maybe it's not supposed to lead to anything. Maybe it's just about being together.

**GARRETT:** I hear you, but I need physical intimacy. That's a legitimate need.

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying it's not legitimate. But you can't force someone to want sex when they don't want it.

**GARRETT:** So I'm just supposed to be miserable?

**ANDRE:** No. You're supposed to figure out if this is something you can live with or not.

**GARRETT:** What do you mean?

**ANDRE:** I mean, if your sex drives are fundamentally incompatible, you might not be right for each other. That's a real thing.

**GARRETT:** But I love her. We're good together in every other way.

**ANDRE:** I know. But sex is a pretty big way. You can't just ignore it.

**GARRETT:** So you think I should break up with her over this?

**ANDRE:** I'm not saying that. I'm saying you need to decide what you can and can't live with. And she needs to decide the same thing.

**GARRETT:** What if she's fine with how things are? What if she doesn't see it as a problem?

**ANDRE:** Then you have an even bigger problem. Because it means you're not on the same page about something fundamental.

**GARRETT:** This sucks.

**ANDRE:** Yeah, it does. I'm sorry, man.

**GARRETT:** Have you and Vanessa ever had this issue?
